It is a sign of a serious enthusiasm gap among the rank and file, and a particularly bad omen for Mitt Romney and the GOP in the general election.</p><p>Here&#x27;s the tale of the tape, state by state, beginning with Tuesday night: Minnesota had just more than 47,000 people turn out for its caucuses this year -- four years ago it was nearly 63,000 -- and Romney came in first, not a distant third as he did Tuesday night. In Colorado, more than 70,000 people turned out for its caucus in 2008 -- but in 2012 it was 65,000. And Missouri -- even making a generous discount for the fact that this was an entirely symbolic contest -- had 232,000 people turn out, less than half the number who did four years ago.</p><p>Even with months of pre-primary hype and attention solely devoted to the Republican field, turnout in this election cycle essentially flat-lined. In Iowa, a little more than 121,000 people voted, compared with nearly 119,000 four years before, when action in the Democratic caucuses absorbed most of the attention.</p><p>In New Hampshire, the same dynamic applied -- 245,000 voters turned out in 2012, compared with 241,000 four years before, despite Republicans being the only game in town and independents making up 47% of the total turnout in 2012, according to CNN exit polls. Take out the independent voters and you&#x27;ve got a deep net decline.</p><p>Always proudly rebellious, South Carolina has been the great outlier in this election cycle. With Newt Gingrich making an all-out push for conservatives in a conservative state, turnout was up almost 150,000 over four years before.</p><p>But in Florida, the decline became unmistakable. Maybe it decreased because the Romney and Gingrich campaigns, plus super PACS, spent more than $18 million in the Sunshine State on TV ads, of which 93% were negative in the last week alone, according to the Campaign Media Analysis Group. After all, negative ads depress turnout. But after all the mud was thrown, 1.6 million people turned out in the nation&#x27;s fourth largest state, which might sound impressive until you compare it with the nearly 2 million who turned out in 2008.</p><p>Nevada was even worse, with 32,894 people turning out to vote in a state with more than 465,000 registered Republicans. Four years before, more than 44,300 participated in the caucus. Turnout was down more than 25% despite the GOP caucuses being the only game in town. Party officials were expecting a turnout of more than 70,000.</p><p>All this should be a wake-up call for the GOP. Despite an enormous amount of national media attention devoted to each of the states to date, the response has been a notable yawn among the Republican rank and file.</p><p>The turnout numbers are even worse when you compare them with the number of registered Republicans in each state that has voted to date.</p><p>The caucuses in particular bring out an unrepresentative sample of a state&#x27;s Republican Party. For all the grass-roots romanticism, there has got to be a better way to pick a presidential nominee.</p><p>But the news is worst for Romney, long the presumptive front-runner in a party that tends to reward the man next in line.</p><p>&quot;Reluctantly Romney&quot; could be a bumper sticker, even for his supporters. The former Massachusetts governor has found it difficult to climb above 35% in national polls, meaning that a majority of Republicans still support someone else in a notably weak field. His vote margins and totals lag behind those of four years before, when he lost the nomination to John McCain in a crowded and comparatively competent field, although Minnesota is the first state he won in &#x27;08 and lost in 2012.</p><p>You reap what you sow, and part of the reason turnout is down is directly related to the problem of polarization. The Republican Party is more ideologically polarized than at any time in recent history. Therefore, it put up more purely right-wing candidates than it did four years before, when center-right leaders such as McCain and Rudy Giuliani were also in the race. A bigger tent inspired bigger turnout.</p><p>But the other reason is simple dissatisfaction with the candidates.</p><p>Republicans seem united in their anger against the president -- like the Democrats in 2004 -- but they are uninspired by their options. Draft movements for fantasy candidates ranging from Chris Christie to Mitch Daniels to Paul Ryan and even Jeb Bush have started and failed. Some party leaders show more enthusiasm for a hypothetical 2016 crop of candidates, including Marco Rubio and Bobby Jindal, than they do for the flawed choices before them in this election. Divided and dispirited is an odd place for the Republican Party to be so soon after the enthusiasms of the 2010 tea party-driven election.</p><p>The bottom line is that voter turnout matters. And what should be most troubling for Republicans is that this enthusiasm gap among the conservative base is accompanied by a lack of candidates who might appeal to independents and centrist swing voters in the general election. It is a double barrel of bad news for the Republican Party.

(They also coax a young woman fresh from yoga class to sip their doughnut-flavored beer while doing the downward dog.)</p><p>Ilan Hall, a chef and the host of &quot;Knife Fight,&quot; describes his series as &quot;a bare-knuckled boxing show of a cooking competition&quot; that pits chefs against each other in an &quot;after-hours war zone.&quot; (He wears a camouflage flak jacket instead of an apron.)</p><p>And sure enough, on this cooking show, eating well is an excuse to drink heavily.</p><p>As a rowdy crowd cheers them on, rival chefs drink shots and fiercely whip up delicacies like braised goat ribs with yogurt and pomegranate. In one episode, John Herndon, who got his start as a flair bartender and still likes to set cocktails and dishes on fire, takes on Trevor Rocco. Mr. Rocco prepares by eating breakfast eggs. &quot;Got to coat your stomach for all the booze we are about to drink,&quot; he explains.</p><p>In November, Esquire plans to introduce more shows, including &quot;Best Bars in America&quot; and &quot;White Collar Brawler,&quot; in which yuppie-esque lawyers, accountants and bankers are taught to box like real men.</p><p>They may have to take a punch. They almost certainly will learn how to use a punch bowl.",

In its seventh edition, this annual festival of contemporary performance announces itself boldly, its name projected in big block letters on the facade of Abrons Arts Center, home to most of the festival&#x27;s 18 boundary-blurring productions.</p><p>It doesn&#x27;t take much to inject new life into an event sometimes at risk of stagnating, even as it champions the fresh, the unseen, the unexpected. At opening night on Thursday, visitors were guided from show to show through stairwells and hallways generally closed to the public. For anyone well acquainted with Abrons, as many Realness-goers are, this proved a simple, effective way to reinvent familiar spaces.</p><p>Masterminded by Thomas Benjamin Snapp Pryor, Realness coincides with the citywide conference of the Association of Performing Arts Presenters \u2014 international curators and producers in the market for new work \u2014 which returns each year like a recurring dream, or nightmare, depending on your relationship to the idea of shopping for live art. Last year&#x27;s festival was full of work bemoaning the economic plight of performers; this year&#x27;s first two productions struck out in less sullen directions, while still folding in some self-reflexive critique (also available in the form of Realness swag declaring, &quot;I Suffer From Realness&quot;).</p><p>First was &quot;Culture Administration &amp; Trembling,&quot; a biodiverse collaboration among the performers Jennifer Lacey, Antonija Livingstone, Dominique P\u00e9trin and Stephen Thompson. Ticket holders were instructed to remove their shoes, then led to the second floor of the arts complex, where a usually drab lobby had been transformed with geometric and botanical designs on the floor and walls.</p><p>Ms. Lacey, Ms. Livingstone, Mr. Thompson and Dana Michel crawled languidly around the asymmetrical room, the audience huddled around the perimeter, to a soundscape of intermittent bird song. Ms. P\u00e9trin appeared just as calmly immersed in her task of adorning the ground with origami squares. Three live snakes, delivered from offstage, soon joined in. Humans and reptiles slid over and around one another.</p><p>This was just the first of many tenuously related, increasingly chaotic episodes, including the arrival of two Chihuahuas (the snakes, not to worry, had exited) and a migration into the adjacent black-box theater for a ritualistic ringing of hand-held bells.

        "source": "Most people, asked to identify the most universal shift in law enforcement over the past 15 years, would likely think of militarization, calls for community policing, or perhaps the slow decline of &quot;broken windows&quot;.</p><p>But from the turn of the millennium to date, arguably no development has been more widespread in law enforcement than the adoption of so called &quot;less-lethal&quot; electric control devices (ECD), which many people know by the name of their most prolific manufacturer: Taser International. The company currently supplies their weapons to 17,800 of the United States&#x27; roughly 18,000 law enforcement agencies.</p><p>The brand name Taser has become as synonymous with these devices as Kleenex or Xerox have to photocopies and tissues \u2013 a quirk of language known as a &quot;proprietary eponym&quot;. The word has even become a verb, as people commonly speak of being &quot;Tased&quot; or &quot;Tasered&quot;.</p><p>The word Taser, though, didn&#x27;t start with the company: it&#x27;s actually a loose acronym of the book Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle. Jack Cover, the inventor of the modern ECD, named his prototype after the YA sci-fi novel he loved, and the very idea for a less-lethal electric gun was largely inspired by the fictional one described in the book.</p><p>And while this quirky history is known among some in law enforcement and engineering circles, the innocence with which it&#x27;s told \u2013 a curious inventor culling inspiration from the literature of his youth \u2013 belies a more sinister truth: the book itself is boldly racist.</p><p>Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle, published in New York in 1911 under the pen name Victor Appleton, is typical of the literature of its time: an imperialist adventure tale set against the backdrop of a wild and dark African continent. In it, the protagonist, Tom Swift, develops an electric rifle \u2013 a totally novel idea in 1911 \u2013 and decides to test it in Africa in the hunt for ivory.</p><p>Africa, in the context of the book, exists only as a frontier of underexploited resources ripe for the wealth accumulation of white men daring enough to attempt. &quot;Elephant shooting in Africa! My! With my new electric rifle ... what a fellow couldn&#x27;t do in the dark continent!&quot;</p><p>&quot;With the price of ivory soaring,&quot; says Swift&#x27;s veteran hunting companion, &quot;there&#x27;s a chance for us all to get a lot of money.&quot;</p><p>While this unabashed entrepreneurial imperialism tends to read as a relic of a bygone age, today disproportionately white police departments in places like Ferguson, Missouri, often function similarly as the adventurers sent to do the dangerous work of this kind of wealth generation. Like in the book, black communities are often seen not as dynamic places where people live lives, but as sites for plunder.</p><p>Take, for example, the Department of Justice&#x27;s March report on the prevalence of predatory, revenue-based policing in St Louis County: entire municipalities there, as elsewhere in the US, float their operating budgets and justify their own existence on the racially biased extraction of statutory fees from primarily black residents. This scheme has only begun to decline because of the protests and organizing that defined Ferguson in the wake of Mike Brown&#x27;s death.</p><p>In the book, as in America today, the black people are rendered as either passive, simple and childlike, or animalistic and capable of unimaginable violence. They are described in the book at various points as &quot;hideous in their savagery, wearing only the loin cloth, and with their kinky hair stuck full of sticks&quot;, and as &quot;wild, savage and ferocious ... like little red apes&quot;.</p><p>Swift and his travel companions quickly determine the blacks, scarcely human, need to be controlled, guided or killed as determined by the more &quot;civilized&quot; white outsiders.</p><p>Consider then how quickly the black people of Ferguson were rendered something less than fully human in the wake of Mike Brown&#x27;s killing: an on-duty Ferguson police officer, a former NYPD commissioner and a popular actor all spared no time in invoking the discourse of &quot;animals&quot; in reference to black protesters. Near and far, incredulous commentators sought to cast the police as the sole defenders of black communities, and the only thing standing between those communities and self-destruction.</p><p>&quot;White police officers wouldn&#x27;t be there if you weren&#x27;t killing each other,&quot; former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani said on Meet the Press last November. Echoing Swift&#x27;s rank paternalism, he later added: &quot;I probably saved more black lives as mayor of New York City than any mayor in the history of this city.&quot;</p><p>In the book, when Swift and his companions proudly use their advanced weapons \u2013 particularly the electric rifle \u2013 to dispatch with an incoming buffalo stampede, they too happily celebrate themselves as saviors.</p><p>&quot;Had it not been for the white men, the native village, which consisted of only frail huts, would have been completely wiped out by the animals,&quot; the novel reads.</p><p>Being named after a racist book doesn&#x27;t make a company or device racist, any more than a person being named after a racist relative makes them so. A name is just that \u2013 and a Taser on its face is no more racist than the city or state of Washington are, simply for being named after our slaveholding first president.</p><p>But as recent campus activism in places such as Harvard and Princeton have demonstrated, there is real value in coming to terms with the bigotry embedded in the seemingly innocuous names and symbols of even our most ordinary, and aspirationally colorblind, institutions.</p><p>Being aware of the history of the word Taser should make us pause and consider that, every day, predominantly white police officers walk into predominantly black communities armed with weapons first imagined in a book in which &quot;civilized&quot; whites entered the black wilds for the purpose of plunder, only to cast themselves as the saviors of the natives. It isn&#x27;t meaningless that today that sequence sometimes appears to persist in reverse.",

        "source": "Most people, asked to identify the most universal shift in law enforcement over the past 15 years, would likely think of militarization, calls for community policing, or perhaps the slow decline of &quot;broken windows&quot;.</p><p>But from the turn of the millennium to date, arguably no development has been more widespread in law enforcement than the adoption of so called &quot;less-lethal&quot; electric control devices (ECD), which many people know by the name of their most prolific manufacturer: Taser International. The company currently supplies their weapons to 17,800 of the United States&#x27; roughly 18,000 law enforcement agencies.</p><p>The brand name Taser has become as synonymous with these devices as Kleenex or Xerox have to photocopies and tissues \u2013 a quirk of language known as a &quot;proprietary eponym&quot;. The word has even become a verb, as people commonly speak of being &quot;Tased&quot; or &quot;Tasered&quot;.</p><p>The word Taser, though, didn&#x27;t start with the company: it&#x27;s actually a loose acronym of the book Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle. Jack Cover, the inventor of the modern ECD, named his prototype after the YA sci-fi novel he loved, and the very idea for a less-lethal electric gun was largely inspired by the fictional one described in the book.</p><p>And while this quirky history is known among some in law enforcement and engineering circles, the innocence with which it&#x27;s told \u2013 a curious inventor culling inspiration from the literature of his youth \u2013 belies a more sinister truth: the book itself is boldly racist.</p><p>Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle, published in New York in 1911 under the pen name Victor Appleton, is typical of the literature of its time: an imperialist adventure tale set against the backdrop of a wild and dark African continent. In it, the protagonist, Tom Swift, develops an electric rifle \u2013 a totally novel idea in 1911 \u2013 and decides to test it in Africa in the hunt for ivory.</p><p>Africa, in the context of the book, exists only as a frontier of underexploited resources ripe for the wealth accumulation of white men daring enough to attempt. &quot;Elephant shooting in Africa! My! With my new electric rifle ... what a fellow couldn&#x27;t do in the dark continent!&quot;</p><p>&quot;With the price of ivory soaring,&quot; says Swift&#x27;s veteran hunting companion, &quot;there&#x27;s a chance for us all to get a lot of money.&quot;</p><p>While this unabashed entrepreneurial imperialism tends to read as a relic of a bygone age, today disproportionately white police departments in places like Ferguson, Missouri, often function similarly as the adventurers sent to do the dangerous work of this kind of wealth generation. Like in the book, black communities are often seen not as dynamic places where people live lives, but as sites for plunder.</p><p>Take, for example, the Department of Justice&#x27;s March report on the prevalence of predatory, revenue-based policing in St Louis County: entire municipalities there, as elsewhere in the US, float their operating budgets and justify their own existence on the racially biased extraction of statutory fees from primarily black residents. This scheme has only begun to decline because of the protests and organizing that defined Ferguson in the wake of Mike Brown&#x27;s death.</p><p>In the book, as in America today, the black people are rendered as either passive, simple and childlike, or animalistic and capable of unimaginable violence. They are described in the book at various points as &quot;hideous in their savagery, wearing only the loin cloth, and with their kinky hair stuck full of sticks&quot;, and as &quot;wild, savage and ferocious ... like little red apes&quot;.</p><p>Swift and his travel companions quickly determine the blacks, scarcely human, need to be controlled, guided or killed as determined by the more &quot;civilized&quot; white outsiders.</p><p>Consider then how quickly the black people of Ferguson were rendered something less than fully human in the wake of Mike Brown&#x27;s killing: an on-duty Ferguson police officer, a former NYPD commissioner and a popular actor all spared no time in invoking the discourse of &quot;animals&quot; in reference to black protesters. Near and far, incredulous commentators sought to cast the police as the sole defenders of black communities, and the only thing standing between those communities and self-destruction.</p><p>&quot;White police officers wouldn&#x27;t be there if you weren&#x27;t killing each other,&quot; former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani said on Meet the Press last November. Echoing Swift&#x27;s rank paternalism, he later added: &quot;I probably saved more black lives as mayor of New York City than any mayor in the history of this city.&quot;</p><p>In the book, when Swift and his companions proudly use their advanced weapons \u2013 particularly the electric rifle \u2013 to dispatch with an incoming buffalo stampede, they too happily celebrate themselves as saviors.</p><p>&quot;Had it not been for the white men, the native village, which consisted of only frail huts, would have been completely wiped out by the animals,&quot; the novel reads.</p><p>Being named after a racist book doesn&#x27;t make a company or device racist, any more than a person being named after a racist relative makes them so.

Gonna blame that on Bush too? like the democrats even said, a few billion is a drop in the bucket. so whats your beef, when we have a 17T, and someone actually tries to do something about it?</p><p>The shutdown forced hundreds of thousands of federal employees and contractors out of work, put government contracts on hold, shuttered national parks and museums and left businesses with fewer customers and lower sales. It&#x27;s too early to know the final cost of those and other effects, but analysts at IHS Global Insight said the hit to gross domestic product from lost government services alone totals $3.1 billion.</p><p>no it put them on furlough, they still get paid for the time they didn&#x27;t work. again, going to cry about 3 billion? to pay back on the interest is close to a trillion alone, what about that? There will also be some impact from lost private-sector jobs tied to the shutdown, as well as a loss of consumer and business confidence resulting from the debt-ceiling showdown,&quot; IHS economists wrote in an analysis released to the media. &quot;The exact impact on the rest of the economy will be hard to measure until delayed economic data are released.&quot;</p><p>what do you think it will be when we can no longer raise our borrowing limit? Even before that data becomes available, analysts at Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s estimated that the shutdown cost $24 billion (or $1.5 billion a day) and slowed the country&#x27;s economic growth rate by an annualized 0.6 percent for the current quarter.</p><p>what have other failed programs, cost us? post some of those. funny I don&#x27;t hear you call foul and point out that when Nodumbo and his band of thieves left Bush tax cuts in place for (what was it 3 years), and then threw in employment and R&amp;D incentives how it hit revenue in the belt? well, you must have forgot how the R&amp;D incentive had not only big business defense contractors, mostly pay in next to nothing and in some get money back from the tax payer huh?</p><p>There will also be some impact from lost private-sector jobs tied to the shutdown, as well as a loss of consumer and business confidence resulting from the debt-ceiling showdown,&quot; IHS economists wrote in an analysis released to the media. &quot;The exact impact on the rest of the economy will be hard to measure until delayed economic data are released.&quot; Even before that data becomes available, analysts at Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s estimated that the shutdown cost $24 billion (or $1.5 billion a day) and slowed the country&#x27;s economic growth rate by an annualized 0.6 percent for the current quarter.</p><p>yet before those number are released your just gonna banter on and on?</p><p>&quot;The bottom line is the government shutdown has hurt the U.S. economy,&quot; S&amp;P said in a statement. &quot;In September, we expected 3 percent annualized growth in the fourth quarter because we thought politicians would have learned from 2011 and taken steps to avoid things like a government shutdown and the possibility of a sovereign default. Since our forecast didn&#x27;t hold, we now have to lower our fourth-quarter growth estimate to closer to 2 percent.&quot; The Washington, D.C. region was hit especially hard. Some local businesses took a major blow since there were fewer tourists and workers shopping and dining out during the shutdown. Pete&#x27;s Diner on Capitol Hill, a favorite of many members of Congress including House Speaker John Boehner, lost about 80 percent of its usual business, according to MSN. Businesses like that diner, located in communities hit hard by the federal government shutdown, will never be able to make that money back. &quot;While the federal workers will receive their back pay, the missed coffee, burgers and cocktails will not be repurchased upon their return,&quot; Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank, said in a statement.</p><p>since when did you care about small business? an idiot can see the ACA is going to kill small business, and those that don&#x27;t fail will have to raise cost, costing the taxpayers plenty. where is your gripe about losss of revenue, because senate and congress get a 72% insurance subsidy? where again is your complaint with loopeholes for big business? where is your complaint that the middle class is going to bear the burden with tax hikes, insurance premiums, and unfair payments, and return subsidy for paying in? funny I work for a government contractor... I still have a job, my insurance is going thru the roof after the 1st of the year, and my out of pocket along with it... where is your complaint that with all this increase, it will put more middle class lower wage earners, on the taxpayer tab, because that loss hits them when it comes to food and paying for gas and electric? They will have to apply for food and energy assistance (the ones who were scraping by as it was) because they can not afford to feed themselves or keep a light on.</p><p>if you, and your ilk were not so ignorant to the obvious (might be because you never worked a day in your life) you would see what this is costing the middle class, and it hasn&#x27;t even gone into effect yet, because they cant get the program up and running due to outdated equipment... where your complaint on that? heck, millions of Americans cant log on to check whats out there... I don&#x27;t hear you crying about the hundreds of millions, now going to be in the billions, because the whole thing will have to be scrapped and started over. go on... let us hear foul on that!</p><p>But the shutdown&#x27;s impact was felt well beyond the nation&#x27;s capital. According to a new survey by International Council of Shopping Centers and Goldman Sachs (GS +0.23%, news), about 40 percent of Americans say they had curbed spending as a result of the shutdown. The survey found that low-income consumers were especially likely to say the shutdown affected their behavior. Nearly half of those earning $35,000 or less said they scaled back their spending, versus about a third of respondents making $100,000 or more.</p><p>well, shucks of course it will affect low income earners behavior! their government benefits are at stake. they have to scale back on spending for reasons such as food share dropped a good chunk, as well as energy assistance. means they have more out of pocket costs. All this you have mentioned if Nodumbo would have least tried to work on spending, and making sure the ACA was ready to go forward for funding, BTW it still is not.",

        "source": "Tim Burrack, a northern Iowa farmer in his 44th growing season, has taken to keeping a wary eye out for unfamiliar vehicles around his 300 acres of genetically modified corn seeds.</p><p>Along with other farmers in this vast agricultural region, he has upped his vigilance ever since Mo Hailong and six other Chinese nationals were accused by U.S. authorities in 2013 of digging up seeds from Iowa farms and planning to send them back to China.</p><p>The case, in which Mo pleaded guilty in January, has laid bare the value\u2014and vulnerability\u2014of advanced food technology in a world with 7 billion mouths to feed, 1.36 billion of them Chinese.</p><p>Citing that case and others as evidence of a growing economic and national security threat to America&#x27;s farm sector, U.S. law enforcement officials are urging agriculture executives and security officers to increase their vigilance and report any suspicious activity.</p><p>But on a March 30 visit to Iowa, Justice Department officials could offer little advice to ensure against similar thefts, underlining how agricultural technology lying in open fields can be more vulnerable than a computer network or a factory floor.</p><p>&quot;It may range down to traditional barriers like a fence and doing human patrols to making sure you get good visuals on what&#x27;s occurring,&quot; Assistant Attorney General John Carlin, head of the Justice Department&#x27;s national security division, said when touring Iowa State University.</p><p>But agriculture sector executives say fences and guards are not feasible, due to the high cost and impracticality of guarding hundreds of thousands of acres.</p><p>Tom McBride, intellectual property attorney at Monsanto\u2014one of the firms whose seeds were targeted by Mo\u2014said it safeguards its genetically modified organism (GMO) technology by protecting its computers, patenting seeds and keeping fields like Burrack&#x27;s unmarked. Monsanto mon says it is not considering physical barriers like fences or guards.</p><p>The FBI and the U.S. Justice Department say cases of espionage in the agriculture sector have been growing since Mo was first discovered digging in an Iowan field in May 2011. Over the past two years, U.S. companies, government research facilities and universities have all been targeted, according to the FBI.</p><p>Although prosecutors were unable to establish a Chinese government link to Mo&#x27;s group, the case adds to U.S.-China frictions over what Washington says is increasing economic espionage and trade secret theft by Beijing and its proxies.</p><p>A U.S. law enforcement official told Reuters the agency looked for a connection between the Chinese government and the conspiracy carried out by Mo.</p><p>&quot;In cases like this, we can see connections, but proving to the threshold needed in court requires that we have documents that the government has directed this,&quot; the official said. &quot;It&#x27;s almost impossible to get.&quot;</p><p>A Chinese embassy spokesman in Washington, Zhu Haiquan, said he did not have detailed information on the Mo case but that China &quot;stands firm&quot; on the protection of intellectual property and maintains &quot;constant communication and cooperation&quot; with the U.S. government on the issue.</p><p>On his visit to Washington last September, President Xi Jinping reiterated China&#x27;s denial of any government role in the hacking of U.S. corporate secrets.</p><p>Mo, an employee of Chinese firm Kings Nower Seed, pleaded guilty to stealing seed grown by U.S. firms Monsanto, Dupont Pioneer dd and LG Seeds.</p><p>Prosecutors say he specifically targeted fields that grow the parent seeds needed to replicate GMO corn. The FBI says it suspects he was given the location by workers for the seed companies, but did not charge any employees.</p><p>DuPont Pioneer and LG Seeds declined to comment for this story.</p><p>Mo, whose case was prosecuted by the Justice Department as a national security matter rather than a simple criminal case, now faces a sentence of up to five years in prison. Five others charged in the case are still wanted by the FBI and are believed to have fled to China or Argentina. Charges were dropped against a sixth Chinese suspect.</p><p>The number of international economic espionage cases referred to the FBI is rising, up 15% each year between 2009 and 2014 and up 53% in 2015.

Rated R: Gory violence, incest theme. 3 1/2 Stars.</p><p>If there&#x27;s a soft spot in your heart for the sword-&amp;-sandal epic - and from the star rating above, I think you can guess where I stand - then you&#x27;ll swoon with giddy delight over &quot;Gladiator,&quot; a sweaty, stylish hunkfest that takes you back to the days of &quot;Ben-Hur,&quot; &quot;Spartacus&quot; and the so recently departed Steve Reeves.</p><p>From his biceps to his gluteus, Maximus is maximus. This Roman general turned slave turned gladiator hasn&#x27;t a shred of humor, but then, he doesn&#x27;t have time for idle nonsense when he&#x27;s lopping off heads all day.

No disinfectant!)</p><p>The supporting cast makes for a gauntlet of worthy friends and adversaries, all of them thinkers, including Derek Jacobi (&quot;I, Claudius&quot;) as a senator, Djimon Hounsou (&quot;Amistad&quot;) as a fellow gladiator and Oliver Reed, who died with two days to go on the shoot, looking a little woozy as a gladiator entrepreneur.</p><p>Reed&#x27;s character is the one most in touch with the movie&#x27;s premise - that entertainment is the goal, and a worthy one at that.",

Barnet is thinking of doing away with school-crossing patrols \u2013 but last year increased its leader&#x27;s allowance by 55 per cent.</p><p>In other words, in preaching localism, the Government has made a similar miscalculation to Mrs Thatcher&#x27;s over the poll tax. It was supposed to increase local accountability: if residents received high bills, they would vote their councils out of office. Instead, the populace took it out on the Government.</p><p>Earlier, Mrs Thatcher had taken a different approach, intervening directly over council overspending by capping the rates. She positioned herself, in effect, as the defender of the people against town hall extravagance. Mr Cameron needs to do something similar: rather than talk about localism, he needs to lay down the law and stop front-line services being cut. It turns out that even the \u00a3800 million he pledged for carers of disabled children is not ring-fenced: it could end up kitting out a councillor&#x27;s office with plasma screens, and the Government couldn&#x27;t do a thing.</p><p>So rather than moaning about councils&#x27; behaviour, why not a slip a clause into the Localism Bill that gives the Government powers to cap salaries at the same level as a Cabinet minister (currently \u00a3134,565)? It would hardly be a vote-loser, even if it doesn&#x27;t fit in with the theme of devolving power. Town hall chiefs may be earning more than Mr Cameron, but that is no reason to fall at their feet. On the contrary: their inflated salaries show where the worst waste and extravagance really lie.</p><p>This is an edited version of a piece that appears in the current issue of &#x27;The Spectator&#x27;",

A new highway, part of a huge ongoing government infrastructure investment, links Saman\u00e1 with the capital, Santo Domingo, and has dramatically reduced travel time from more than five hours to under 2\u00bd.</p><p>The newly emerging Saman\u00e1 Peninsula began as a second-home destination for Dominicans but is increasingly being &quot;discovered&quot; by overseas buyers.</p><p>&quot;On the south of the peninsula, the biggest city is Saman\u00e1, which has the cruise dock and several new developments, the largest of which is Puerto Bahia, attracting more Dominican buyers,&quot; says Pedro Purcell, a broker with Dominican Properties in Santo Domingo.</p><p>&quot;The two highest-profile developments are on the north, Balcones del Atl\u00e1ntico and El Portillo. There are more American buyers in the north, as well as French, Germans and Italians.</p><p>&quot;Unlike Punta Cana, Saman\u00e1 is mostly condos, not the big villas and estate homes, and it is not as expensive as Cap Cana or Casa de Campo to the south, where people look for celebrities,&quot; Purcell adds.</p><p>&quot;Here, they look for the beach lifestyle, and while the projects are high-quality, they are not nearly as large as in the Punta Cana area.&quot;</p><p>A look at three North Shore neighborhoods</p><p>\u2022 Puerto Plata. The Dominican Republic&#x27;s first major tourism enclave, this beach town has a lot of hotel and restaurant development, but with few second homes besides Seahorse Ranch, which was built in the 1980s. The gated 250-acre equestrian and beach community has more than 100 private homes ranging from $500,000 to $8 million. The Victoria Hotel within the Playa Dorado golf resort here plans to begin offering a fractional ownership club this year.</p><p>\u2022 Cabarete. Less developed than Puerto Plata, beach-centric Cabarete has until recently attracted mainly European buyers. That is about to change with the transformation of the Playa Grande golf course \u2014 known as &quot;the Pebble Beach of the Caribbean&quot; \u2014 into a high-end residential community. It will include an equestrian center, clubhouse and recreational facilities, with villas and estate houses on sale later this year. Luxury Asian developer Aman is also planning a private enclave of residential villas here.</p><p>\u2022 Samana Peninsula. Several towns on this 40-mile-long peninsula are seeing development, but for U.S. buyers, the runaway favorite is Las Terrenas. Already home to several boutique hotels, the longtime fishing village is emerging as a culinary hotspot, with European chefs taking advantage of the seafood. A 66-acre former coconut plantation, Las Terrenas&#x27; Balcones del Atlantico will have 350 residences, from apartments to beach villas, from $475,000 to $1.7 million. The second of three phases, which includes a hotel from RockResorts, opens this summer.</p><p>You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

Pole-sitter and defending race winner Helio Castroneves was fifth-fastest (224.573), two spots below Team Penske teammate Will Power (224.993) but five higher than Ryan Briscoe (223.493).</p><p>Temperatures reached the 90s during the morning practice, with no incidents reported. With similar conditions are forecast for Sunday, drivers came away feeling good having a solid weather baseline for setting up the car.</p><p>&quot;I don&#x27;t know if the speeds (on Sunday) will be quite that high, but we might have to run that pace,&quot; Franchitti said. &quot;A lot depends on the car keeping its balance and grip with the (changing) weather.&quot;</p><p>The practice also gave drivers a chance to try out the push-to-pass button, which will make its Brickyard debut. The feature, which provides 18 seconds of extra horsepower, can be used 15 times during the race.</p><p>Franchitti seemed to like it, though he probably won&#x27;t need it as much as one of the race favorites. But he expects it to figure in down the stretch because that&#x27;s when most drivers will save their allotment for.</p><p>&quot;You&#x27;ve got to know how to use it at the start and on restarts, but you want to save some for the end,&quot; he said.</p><p>Most drivers remained consistent with their practice times, though some of the higher qualifiers were slower than expected in the heat.

It was a good era if you wanted a kir, steak frites, escargot, fris\u00e9e lardon, profiteroles. Authenticity, or some version of it, was the point. Everybody was pressing butter into little ramekins to be served at room temperature, changing the paper covering the tablecloths before serving dessert.</p><p>Honestly, it was really fun. The restaurants were lively, intimate, sexy. So what if you could recite the menu before you set foot in the door? But if you were a young chef with a measure of vision and creativity, you were stuck either making onion soup and beet salad with goat cheese. Or you worked on the line executing the vision and creativity of an older chef in Midtown or TriBeCa. Prune hadn&#x27;t yet opened. Neither had Diner. Brooklyn didn&#x27;t have much of a food scene outside the restaurant row on Smith Street, which was anchored by Patois, a bistro. If you went to Williamsburg, it was to go to a party or to go dancing, not to eat. This was the landscape when Jason and Jennifer Denton opened &#x27;ino on a quiet street in the West Village. The kitchen in the back was the size of a D.J. booth and used the technology of induction burners, which was novel at the time: it was a paninoteca that looked as if it belonged in New York rather than being shipped, tile by mirrored tile, from Milan.</p><p>The culinary vocabulary was Italian, but it wasn&#x27;t sepia-toned and sentimental. Instead, there was a focus on ingredients at a time when, in New York at least, few people cared. It had simple food done well, and sometimes you encountered flavors that weren&#x27;t lifted out of the songbook. I still have a 13-year-old memory of sharing a shredded duck sandwich with sweet relish, a combination that is about as authentically Italian as a functioning parliament. You could go to &#x27;ino to get something familiar (prosciutto and cheese will never get old), but you could also try something new.</p><p>&#x27;Ino was a casual joint with integrity, an easygoing place where you could eat well as long as you didn&#x27;t mind the wait. Today, we take this combination for granted, and expect all kitchens to put some effort into sourcing and display a little creativity no matter how limited the resources. That we do owes a little bit to &#x27;ino.",

        "source": "By DEXTER FORDMAY 9, 2014</p><p>MALIBU, CALIF. \u2014 Good luck, America, with your efforts to pigeonhole the BMW i8.</p><p>The car is a post-petroleum brand statement. It&#x27;s a sci-fi showpiece. It&#x27;s an ultralight carbon-fiber production car. It&#x27;s a triumph of parts-bin engineering. It&#x27;s a take-no-prisoners canyon racer. It&#x27;s a winged chariot of the Malibu \u00fcber-chic. It&#x27;s a $136,625 (destination included!) commuter car for Silicon Valley moguls.</p><p>The hardware, at least, is straightforward. The central passenger shell is a stiff, lightweight carbon-fiber structure. It is bolted to an aluminum skeleton that holds the 7.1-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack in its spine.</p><p>An electric drive section similar to the one in the BMW i3 people pod is bolted to the front, its 131 horsepower electric motor and 2-speed automatic transmission driving the front wheels. The rear power package is sourced from the new Mini; its 3-cylinder, twin-turbocharged 231-horsepower engine drives the rear wheels through a 6-speed automatic transmission.</p><p>The multilayered skin is molded thermoplastic that weighs half as much as steel. Other extreme weight-saving measures, including aluminum wiring and chemically hardened ultrathin glass, keep the weight to 3,267 pounds. The long, light doors swing up and forward. From the front, with doors open, the i8 looks as if it&#x27;s signaling a touchdown.</p><p>The interior is compact yet comfortable, though those over 6-foot-2 may need more legroom, and the rear seats are designed for tiny, limber people.</p><p>Getting in is a challenge. The sill is wide, the seat is low, and there&#x27;s a trick: sit sideways, slide butt in, retract legs. Getting out? Imagine climbing from a bathtub without using your hands.</p><p>Pick a personality with the driving-mode buttons. &quot;Comfort&quot; keeps the car in electric mode to 37 m.p.h., or until you mash the right-side pedal. The eDrive button keeps things electric to 75 m.p.h. or until the battery fades.</p><p>Travel range is about 20 miles in E.V. mode, and recharging takes 1.5 hours at 240 volts or four hours at 120. The Eco-Pro button increases electric efficiency 20 percent by softening the motor response and optimizing climate-control settings. I observed gasoline-powered mileage figures from 27 m.p.g. (impatient cornering) to 37 m.p.g. (safe-and-sane commuting).</p><p>In the city, the i8 feels silent, solid and intuitive \u2014 the excitement happens outside, as gawkers track its progress.</p><p>On Los Angeles&#x27;s well-used freeways, the Comfort setting leaves some comfort to be desired. Even with the variable dampers at full soft, the i8 bobs its nose like Muhammad Ali in the first rounds. High-performance tires come standard in the United States; European versions get narrower wheels and taller tires for lower drag and a smoother ride.</p><p>In Sport mode, the suspension and steering stiffen and the gas engine roars, pops on upshifts and matches revs downshifting into corners. It sounds great, and it should: much of what you hear is a prerecorded soundtrack piped through the sound system.</p><p>The i8 feels strong at full power, but the head-snapping response expected from a partly electric powertrain is absent. The i8 takes time to gather itself, with an atavistic vestige of turbo lag.</p><p>On the intestinal twists of Mulholland Highway the i8 can be driven with brutal abandon. The brakes are strong, the chassis is as stiff as a bank vault, and there&#x27;s enough power to reach the next corner presently. BMW claims a 0-to-60 time of 4.2 seconds, and top speed is 155 m.p.h.</p><p>The front tires push when going hard into corners, but everything sticks coming out. Even with the stability control off, the i8 resists spinning its tires \u2014 the software ghost is still there, lurking in the machine.</p><p>The i8 is complicated and imperfect. A car that will be used for emissions-free commuting should allow people to get in and get out. It rides harshly. The exterior design is too clever \u2014 the layered rear deck whispers &quot;Your trunk is open.&quot;</p><p>Still, if the i8 represents the future of sports cars, things are looking bright.</p><p>A version of this review appears in print on May 11, 2014, on page AU4 of the New York edition with the headline: The Future Will See You Now.

(safe-and-sane commuting).</p><p>In the city, the i8 feels silent, solid and intuitive \u2014 the excitement happens outside, as gawkers track its progress.</p><p>On Los Angeles&#x27;s well-used freeways, the Comfort setting leaves some comfort to be desired. Even with the variable dampers at full soft, the i8 bobs its nose like Muhammad Ali in the first rounds. High-performance tires come standard in the United States; European versions get narrower wheels and taller tires for lower drag and a smoother ride.</p><p>In Sport mode, the suspension and steering stiffen and the gas engine roars, pops on upshifts and matches revs downshifting into corners. It sounds great, and it should: much of what you hear is a prerecorded soundtrack piped through the sound system.</p><p>The i8 feels strong at full power, but the head-snapping response expected from a partly electric powertrain is absent. The i8 takes time to gather itself, with an atavistic vestige of turbo lag.</p><p>On the intestinal twists of Mulholland Highway the i8 can be driven with brutal abandon. The brakes are strong, the chassis is as stiff as a bank vault, and there&#x27;s enough power to reach the next corner presently. BMW claims a 0-to-60 time of 4.2 seconds, and top speed is 155 m.p.h.</p><p>The front tires push when going hard into corners, but everything sticks coming out. Even with the stability control off, the i8 resists spinning its tires \u2014 the software ghost is still there, lurking in the machine.</p><p>The i8 is complicated and imperfect. A car that will be used for emissions-free commuting should allow people to get in and get out. It rides harshly. The exterior design is too clever \u2014 the layered rear deck whispers &quot;Your trunk is open.&quot;</p><p>Still, if the i8 represents the future of sports cars, things are looking bright.</p><p>A version of this review appears in print on May 11, 2014, on page AU4 of the New York edition with the headline: The Future Will See You Now.

        "source": "Estimated years until debt-free: Unknown</p><p>Like many of my friends, I remember the evening I told my parents I wanted to go to college. We all have different stories about the moment we took control of our lives. But what we share is this: by signing on a dotted line to incomprehensible terms, we risked everything. We chose education, no matter the cost. In some cases, we alienated ourselves from our families and communities.</p><p>By spending money we didn&#x27;t have to attend schools we couldn&#x27;t afford, we joined an elite class we&#x27;d never truly fit into. We are, in a way, without community. As a result of pursuing higher education, I am highly educated and deeply in debt. If you don&#x27;t have a similar story of adversity \u2013 and you&#x27;re not in debt \u2013 you&#x27;re probably not my friend.</p><p>I grew up in a working-class neighborhood outside Cleveland, Ohio, where I was taught that if only I followed the rules, I could succeed. I was so good a student that a guidance counselor suggested Antioch College, a prestigious yet expensive liberal arts school. My mom made it her mission that I attend. She saw that I entered every high school essay contest and applied for every merit-based scholarship that I could. That same year, my father had skipped out on us; I was now 18, and he was legally absolved of all financial responsibility.</p><p>With my mother&#x27;s help, I paid for my entire first year with scholarships and other merit-based aid. Then, I began living off a credit card.</p><p>Horace Mann, the founder of my alma mater, called education &quot;the great equalizer&quot;. In some ways, it&#x27;s true. For the poor and working-class student who finds themselves let into a wealthy institution, every part of being there can be an education that helps level the field. At the same time, I felt markedly different than my peers in ways I couldn&#x27;t articulate. Before I came to Antioch \u2013 where it seemed like half the campus was either vegetarian or vegan \u2013 I&#x27;d never met anyone who offered political reasons to refuse food.</p><p>By the end of my first year, I knew better than to think that people got ahead just by following the rules. My elite peers had something I didn&#x27;t, something I might never have, something that was no result of hard work. In high school I&#x27;d worked minimum wage jobs just so I could afford to dress like everyone else, scouring discount stores for deals on the latest fashions. At Antioch, people wore &quot;thrift store finds&quot; and lived in intentional squalor, swearing off hygienic and other consumer products that I didn&#x27;t have the money to buy.</p><p>I was bitter, envious. I felt entitled to what they had \u2013 no more, but no less. I was tired of working two or three jobs at a time while going to school and still not having enough. When my second year of college came and the scholarships stopped, I started working as a stripper. As a sex worker I was rolling in cash, but still lacking in financial literacy.</p><p>Poor people make choices that wealthier people wouldn&#x27;t. We are in debt for reasons those who aren&#x27;t can&#x27;t comprehend. Rather than explain myself, I gravitate toward those with similar experiences.</p><p>After college, I lost my job as a public school teacher when it was revealed that I had worked in the sex industry. The fact that I was a competent teacher made no difference to my critics. It took years to re-establish myself in a new career as a writer. In the meantime, I hemorrhaged debt.</p><p>Now, five or so years later, I&#x27;ve paid off most my credit cards, but I don&#x27;t expect I&#x27;ll ever pay off my student loans. With three degrees, and after years of deferment, the amount due hovers somewhere around $80,000. Some people don&#x27;t get why. They ask: why did you go to a college you couldn&#x27;t afford? Why did you pursue a second and then a third degree if you couldn&#x27;t pay off the first one? Why did you pursue degrees in fields that will never pay off? I used to feel ashamed. Then I learned to tell my story, and surrounded myself with people who understood.</p><p>People in debt are some of the brightest, most resilient people there are. Today I have no regrets. Coming from little made me the woman I am.",

We don&#x27;t have that kind of money&quot; or the staff or equipment, so a simpler method had to be found, Shastri said.</p><p>Starting in 1998, researchers enrolled 75,360 women to be screened every two years with the vinegar test. Another 76,178 women were chosen for a control, or comparison group that just got cancer education at the start of the study and vouchers for a free Pap test \u2014 if they could get to the hospital to have one.

The study was planned for 16 years, but results at 12 years showed lives were saved with the screening. So independent monitors advised offering it to the women in the comparison group.</p><p>An ethics controversy developed during the study. The U.S. Office for Human Research Protections faulted researchers for not adequately informing participants in the comparison group about Pap tests for screening. A letter from the agency in March indicated officials seemed to accept many of the remedies study leaders had implemented.</p><p>&quot;We looked at the ethics very carefully&quot; and felt them to be sound, and visited the project in India, said Trimble of the National Cancer Institute.</p><p>Dr. Sandra Swain, a cancer specialist at Medstar Washington Hospital Center, also defended the research. She is president of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, and the research results were presented at that group&#x27;s meeting in Chicago on Sunday.</p><p>&quot;There really was no wrongdoing there,&quot; she said. &quot;They have no screening anyway,&quot; so there is no standard of care now.</p><p>Officials in India already are making plans to expand the vinegar testing to a wider population.</p><p>Many poor countries can&#x27;t afford mammograms for breast cancer screening either. The India study also has been testing breast exams by health workers as an alternative. Preliminary results suggest breast cancers are being found at an earlier stage, but it&#x27;s too soon to know if that will save lives because not enough women have died yet to compare the groups, said Trimble of the National Cancer Institute.</p><p>More progress against cervical cancer may come from last month&#x27;s announcement that two companies will drastically lower prices on HPV vaccines for poor countries. Pilot projects will begin in Asia and Africa; the campaign aims to vaccinate more than 30 million girls in more than 40 countries by 2020.",
        "system_output": "the research effort was led by dr. surendra shastri of tata memorial hospital in mumbai , researchers enrolled 75,360 women to be screened every two years with the world &#x27;s cases of cervical cancer -- more than 140,000 each year it &#x27;s just not possible to provide pap smear screening in a deeply conservative country where women are subservient and need permission from husbands , fathers or others for even routine decisions .",

It&#x27;s not the heat, it&#x27;s the sensitivity. How much it will warm in the future is a function of how sensitive the atmosphere is to doubling atmospheric carbon dioxide. There are a number of independent arguments now coming together showing that this value may have been overestimated. The reference for the most recent is a November issue of Science.</p><p>Next, a little refreshing honesty: in 2009, the House of Representatives passed a cap-and-trade bill (which the Senate did not) commanding that the average american\u201438 years from now\u2014be allowed the carbon dioxide emissions of the average citizen in 1867. Prior to its passage, Newt was undeniably for such a system. Newt could call that that the &quot;second dumbest thing&quot; he has done and be finished with it.</p><p>After setting the record straight, how about interjecting his own political philosophy? When asked what to do about global warming, he should give the honest answer: if the atmosphere indeed is not as sensitive to carbon dioxide changes as previously thought, the correct response is nothing.</p><p>That&#x27;s because &quot;nothing&quot; really means something. Newt should channel his historian. When markets are free, capital supports innovation more efficiently than when they aren&#x27;t. Think about the remarkable changes in energy and technology in the last 100 years. Isn&#x27;t it rather obvious that the same will occur in the next century, if only we don&#x27;t hinder capital development? Newt might even use the catchy saw (first sloganed by Northern Illinois Gas in 1972) the future belongs to the efficient, and that there are impressive market forces that advantage those who produce things efficiently or produce efficient things.</p><p>When the doomsayers say Newt is believing in a Deus ex machine to dramatically cut carbon dioxide emissions, he might point out that those were the same folks who, only a very few years ago, told us we were running out of natural gas. Innovation and capital revolutionized drilling and fracturing shale, and we now know we have literally hundreds of years of it under our feet. There are a lot more voters and delegates around the country who will benefit from the shale revolution than there are in ethanol-addicted Iowa.",

The American people rejected that, and Republicans shouldn&#x27;t be doubling down on it.&quot;</p><p>The White House effort comes three days before Obama releases his 2014 budget, which is expected to include a mix of tax increases and cuts to such entitlements as Social Security and Medicare.</p><p>&quot;You can do both,&quot; Pfeiffer said on ABC&#x27;s &quot;This Week.&quot; &quot;That&#x27;s what you&#x27;ll see. \u2026 What we won&#x27;t do is cut our way to prosperity.&quot;</p><p>However, the outline of the plan has already been criticized by Republicans and some of the president&#x27;s staunchest supporters.</p><p>The release of the budget Wednesday, which will be followed by Obama meeting for dinner with Senate Republicans, is just part of a busy week in Washington.</p><p>Congress returns from a two-week break with the Senate attempting to reach a bipartisan agreement on immigration-reform legislation, and the leaders of the Democrat-controlled chamber trying to finish a gun-control proposal that might or might not include the contentious universal background checks for buyers.</p><p>Pfeiffer told Fox the meeting with Senate Republicans is simply an attempt to find a &quot;caucus of common sense,&quot; not end run leaders of the Republican-controlled House.</p><p>Last week, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said Obama&#x27;s budget blueprint holds reforms &quot;hostage&quot; to tax increases. Organized labor also expressed its disappointment in the plan.</p><p>&quot;The president should drop these misguided cuts in benefits and focus instead on building support in Congress for investing in jobs,&quot; AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said.</p><p>Obama supporters disagree particularly with the part of his spending plan that calls for a new inflation formula that would reduce the annual cost of living adjustments for a range of government programs, including Social Security and benefits for veterans.</p><p>Still, South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham expressed optimism Sunday about the plan, suggesting it was at least a starting point toward an elusive, long-term budget deal between Democrats and Republicans.</p><p>&quot;The president is showing a little bit of leg here,&quot; Graham said on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Meet the Press.&quot; &quot;This is somewhat encouraging. We&#x27;re beginning to set the stage for the grand bargain.&quot;</p><p>Among the highlights of the president&#x27;s plan is spending cuts and tax increases that would reduce the deficit by $1.8 trillion over 10 years, replacing the $1.2 trillion in automatic spending cuts, known as sequester, over the same period.</p><p>The proposal also is expected to include new spending for public works projects, early education and job training, as well as $580 billion in new taxes that Republicans oppose.</p><p>Counting reductions and higher taxes that Congress and Obama have approved since 2011, the 2014 budget would contribute $4.3 trillion to total deficit reduction by 2023.</p><p>On Saturday, the president said his budget was not his &quot;ideal plan,&quot; but it was a compromise that he would be willing to accept.</p><p>The House and Senate have already passed their own budget plans. The House plan cuts $5.7 trillion in spending and balances the budget in 10 years while the Senate plan increases taxes by $1 trillion.</p><p>The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

Ciancia managed to tell officials at the scene that a friend had driven him to LAX but that he had acted alone, according to the Associated Press.</p><p>A graphic photo in the New York Post showed Ciancia on the ground with a mangled face and beside pools of blood. By Saturday Ciancia, under guard at hospital, was &quot;unresponsive&quot; and could not be interviewed, said Bowdich. He was charged with first-degree murder and committing violence at an international airport and may face the death penalty.</p><p>Authorities believe the friend who dropped Ciancia off in a black Hyundai on Friday morning was unaware of his plan. Ciancia had no ticket or reservation.</p><p>Los Angeles police wore black armbands in tributes to Hernandez, the slain agent. He move to the US from El Salvador at the age of 15 and joined the TSA three years ago, routinely rising at 3am for his shift. His widow, Ana Hernandez, flanked by TSA chief John Pistole, told a press conference the family had lost a loving husband and father.</p><p>&quot;I am truly devastated,&quot; she said. Later she told NBC: &quot;He was always excited to go to work. He was a joyful person, he took pride in his duty for the American public and for the TSA mission.&quot;</p><p>The FBI said it had found no evidence that Ciancia consorted with radical groups but hoped to establish why he had a grudge against the TSA, said Bowdich. &quot;We are really going to draw a picture of who this person was, his background, his history. That will help us explain why he chose to do what he did. At this point, I don&#x27;t have the answer on that.&quot;</p><p>Ciancia grew up in Pennsville, a blue-collar New Jersey suburb, and was described by former classmates as quiet and reserved. His father owned a successful garage. His mother died of multiple sclerosis in 2009. Two years later, Ciancia graduated from the Motorcycle Mechanics Institute in Orlando, which taught him to fix Harley-Davidsons. Soon after, he moved to Los Angeles.</p><p>He struggled to find work.

Within six weeks of the firing on Fort Sumter, Gen. Benjamin Butler was forced to decide what to do with three slaves who escaped to Fortress Monroe on the north shore of Virginia&#x27;s James River. Butler, certainly no abolitionist, nonetheless refused to return the three to their owner, labeling them &quot;contrabands of war.&quot;</p><p>The term, suitably ambiguous for an administration that as yet had no policy on how to handle the fugitives, found immediate acceptance. As one Union officer wrote, &quot;Never was a word so speedily adopted by so many people in so short a time.&quot; Within weeks hundreds of &quot;contrabands&quot; \u2014 men, women and children \u2014 flocked to Fortress Monroe and other Union Army positions. Unsure what might greet them, the escaped slaves were yet confident that life under federal control must surely represent an improvement.</p><p>It took the federal government more than a year to devise a policy in answer to this thirst for freedom. In August 1861, the First Confiscation Act stripped slaveholders of their claim of ownership, but it failed to clarify whether the slaves were themselves free. The following March Congress prohibited the military from sending escaped slaves back into slavery, and in July the Second Confiscation Act decreed that all slaves that took refuge in Union areas were &quot;captives of war&quot; and would be set free.</p><p>These legislative actions took on ever greater significance as Union forces moved deeper and deeper into Confederate territory. The growing number of contrabands reaching federal lines necessitated the establishment of dozens of impromptu contraband camps. A draft map compiled by the National Park Service illustrates how the network of these generally transitory camps mirrored the advance of the Union Army along the Mississippi, Tennessee and Cumberland River systems. Grant&#x27;s Army of the Tennessee spent the summer of 1862 protecting supply lines in western Tennessee and northern Mississippi. Victories at the Battle of Iuka in September and the Battle of Corinth in early October solidified Union control of the area.</p><p>Lincoln&#x27;s announcement of the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation on Sept. 22, 1862, produced an even greater flood of refugees. How best to use and care for these contrabands proved particularly vexing for military leaders under Grant&#x27;s command. &quot;You have no idea of the consternation Old Abe&#x27;s Proclamation is making,&quot; wrote Gen. Grenville Dodge to his brother in September. The contrabands &quot;will not even wait until 1st January. I do not know what we shall do with them.&quot;</p><p>Many of these fugitives arrived in an appalling condition. &quot;There were men, women, and children in every stage of disease or decrepitude often nearly naked, with flesh torn by the terrible experiences of their escape,&quot; wrote one observer. &quot;Often the slaves met prejudices against their color more bitter than any they had left behind.&quot;</p><p>On Nov. 11, 1862, Grant took the first step toward addressing the crisis: he named John Eaton, a former high school principal and chaplain of the 27th Ohio Infantry, as superintendent of contrabands and set him at work &quot;organizing them into suitable companies for working.&quot; A month later he went further. &quot;The negroes will be clothed, and in every way provided for, out of their earnings&quot; \u2014 about 12.5 cents for each pound of cotton picked \u2014 &quot;so far as practicable,&quot; he ordered. &quot;In no case will negroes be forced into the service of the Government, or be enticed away from their homes except when it becomes a military necessity.&quot;</p><p>Grant&#x27;s policies lent the contraband camps an official status and began to define what a freedman could and could not do once within the Union lines. Personally, Grant appears to have had no particular sympathy for the refugees. He seems to have recognized that, in the words of one observer, &quot;The soldiers of our army were a good deal opposed to serving the Negro in any manner.&quot; Nevertheless, the Union commander unreservedly supported Eaton&#x27;s work and in the process enabled the creation of one of the war&#x27;s most successful contraband camps, located at Corinth, Miss.</p><p>Although formally organized under the direction of General Dodge in early December 1862 and placed under the command of James M. Alexander, chaplain of the 66th Illinois, the Corinth camp likely came into existence as early as September. Initially housed in army tents no longer considered serviceable for Union troops, the freedmen were soon set to work downing trees and clearing land on which to build cabins and lay out streets, which were named for Union generals. Eventually the freedmen also built a four-room school, a commissary, a hospital, a church and an office. The entire camp was divided into wards, complete with ward masters and a police force.</p><p>In late 1862 the American Missionary Association sent its first volunteers to Corinth to help care for, educate and minister to the freedmen. In a memoir written years after the war, one such missionary recalled her experience. &quot;When brought face to face with the slaves,&quot; she wrote, &quot;it was like the discovery of a new race.&quot; The men and women who came to Corinth generally shared a paternalistic optimism and viewed the freedmen as childlike in their enthusiasm for both education and salvation.</p><p>The freedmen&#x27;s thirst for knowledge was undeniable. &quot;You will find them every hour of daylight, at their books,&quot; observed the Rev. Edward Pierce in March of 1863. &quot;We cannot enter a cabin, or tent, but that we see from one to three with books.&quot; Within no time Pierce and his wife had more than 150 students, and by the end of the summer, the addition of more missionaries enabled the school to accommodate between 300 and 400 children as well as 60 adults at a night school. In August, one of the teachers estimated that as many as 1,000 freedmen had learned to read in the Corinth camp.</p><p>Organized religion followed closely on the heels of formal education. Reverend Olds &quot;saw an earnestness in reference to the Christian life that I have seldom seen. And as I saw their deep earnestness &amp; heard their hearty responses,&quot; he said, &quot;I was led to ask where can we find a more impressible people than these?&quot;</p><p>The population of the camp fluctuated between 1,500 and 6,000, as large groups undertook assignments for the Union Army or contracted to work on local plantations. In March 1863, for example, the camp was home to 658 men, 1,440 women and 1,559 children. Among the men were 36 blacksmiths, 48 carpenters, 180 teamsters and 200 cooks. The female ranks included 80 seamstresses, 150 laundresses and 600 cooks. Two-thirds of the men and three-quarters of the women were married, and seven in eight women had children. According to John Eaton&#x27;s records, the camp had experienced 900 cases of illness, 189 deaths and 45 births.</p><p>Life at Corinth changed dramatically after a May 1863 visit by Adj. Gen. Lorenzo Thomas, who was intent on recruiting thousands of contrabands for his newly formed black regiments. With the organization of the 1st Alabama Infantry of African Descent, later renamed the 55th United States Colored Troops, the camp lost most of its able-bodied men.</p><p>Their departure to fight left only the women, the young, the old and the infirm to carry on Eaton&#x27;s ambitious agricultural program, which rested on the cooperative farming of large tracts of abandoned and confiscated land. The program put 400 acres under cultivation, 300 for cotton and 100 for vegetables. Each cabin also had its own subsistence garden. By May 1863, the success of the agricultural program and the presence of a multitude of skilled artisans produced a clear monthly profit of $4,000 to $5,000 for the government, as well as an admirably independent community that Eaton hoped might serve as a model for other camps.</p><p>Unfortunately, the success of the Corinth camp proved short-lived. Plans for a winter campaign by Union forces in January 1864 provided a grim reminder that the fate of the freedmen was always secondary to the triumph of the Union cause. The order to relocate the camp&#x27;s inhabitants 93 miles westward, to Memphis, &quot;fell like a bomb-shell among our contented people,&quot; lamented one missionary, &quot;but military orders are preemptory,&quot; and they &quot;must be obeyed.&quot; The freedmen left their &quot;well-organized village,&quot; gardens and farms to tdiv&gt;</p><p>The move from Corinth destroyed the spirit that had animated the freedmen&#x27;s success. Some of the new refugees found work on confiscated plantations or in Memphis, but most lived in one of several camps surrounding the city.</p><p>&quot;The destruction of the Corinth camp,&quot; noted one historian, &quot;was one of the tragedies of the Civil War.&quot; Eaton&#x27;s plan for large-scale cooperative farming fell victim to a bitter struggle between the War and Treasury departments over the leasing of plantations and was never implemented elsewhere.

Personally, Grant appears to have had no particular sympathy for the refugees. He seems to have recognized that, in the words of one observer, &quot;The soldiers of our army were a good deal opposed to serving the Negro in any manner.&quot; Nevertheless, the Union commander unreservedly supported Eaton&#x27;s work and in the process enabled the creation of one of the war&#x27;s most successful contraband camps, located at Corinth, Miss.</p><p>Although formally organized under the direction of General Dodge in early December 1862 and placed under the command of James M. Alexander, chaplain of the 66th Illinois, the Corinth camp likely came into existence as early as September. Initially housed in army tents no longer considered serviceable for Union troops, the freedmen were soon set to work downing trees and clearing land on which to build cabins and lay out streets, which were named for Union generals. Eventually the freedmen also built a four-room school, a commissary, a hospital, a church and an office. The entire camp was divided into wards, complete with ward masters and a police force.</p><p>In late 1862 the American Missionary Association sent its first volunteers to Corinth to help care for, educate and minister to the freedmen. In a memoir written years after the war, one such missionary recalled her experience. &quot;When brought face to face with the slaves,&quot; she wrote, &quot;it was like the discovery of a new race.&quot; The men and women who came to Corinth generally shared a paternalistic optimism and viewed the freedmen as childlike in their enthusiasm for both education and salvation.</p><p>The freedmen&#x27;s thirst for knowledge was undeniable. &quot;You will find them every hour of daylight, at their books,&quot; observed the Rev. Edward Pierce in March of 1863. &quot;We cannot enter a cabin, or tent, but that we see from one to three with books.&quot; Within no time Pierce and his wife had more than 150 students, and by the end of the summer, the addition of more missionaries enabled the school to accommodate between 300 and 400 children as well as 60 adults at a night school.

In March 1863, for example, the camp was home to 658 men, 1,440 women and 1,559 children. Among the men were 36 blacksmiths, 48 carpenters, 180 teamsters and 200 cooks. The female ranks included 80 seamstresses, 150 laundresses and 600 cooks. Two-thirds of the men and three-quarters of the women were married, and seven in eight women had children. According to John Eaton&#x27;s records, the camp had experienced 900 cases of illness, 189 deaths and 45 births.</p><p>Life at Corinth changed dramatically after a May 1863 visit by Adj. Gen.

By May 1863, the success of the agricultural program and the presence of a multitude of skilled artisans produced a clear monthly profit of $4,000 to $5,000 for the government, as well as an admirably independent community that Eaton hoped might serve as a model for other camps.</p><p>Unfortunately, the success of the Corinth camp proved short-lived.

How best to use and care for these contrabands proved particularly vexing for military leaders under Grant&#x27;s command. &quot;You have no idea of the consternation Old Abe&#x27;s Proclamation is making,&quot; wrote Gen.

Personally, Grant appears to have had no particular sympathy for the refugees. He seems to have recognized that, in the words of one observer, &quot;The soldiers of our army were a good deal opposed to serving the Negro in any manner.&quot; Nevertheless, the Union commander unreservedly supported Eaton&#x27;s work and in the process enabled the creation of one of the war&#x27;s most successful contraband camps, located at Corinth, Miss.</p><p>Although formally organized under the direction of General Dodge in early December 1862 and placed under the command of James M. Alexander, chaplain of the 66th Illinois, the Corinth camp likely came into existence as early as September. Initially housed in army tents no longer considered serviceable for Union troops, the freedmen were soon set to work downing trees and clearing land on which to build cabins and lay out streets, which were named for Union generals. Eventually the freedmen also built a four-room school, a commissary, a hospital, a church and an office. The entire camp was divided into wards, complete with ward masters and a police force.</p><p>In late 1862 the American Missionary Association sent its first volunteers to Corinth to help care for, educate and minister to the freedmen. In a memoir written years after the war, one such missionary recalled her experience. &quot;When brought face to face with the slaves,&quot; she wrote, &quot;it was like the discovery of a new race.&quot; The men and women who came to Corinth generally shared a paternalistic optimism and viewed the freedmen as childlike in their enthusiasm for both education and salvation.</p><p>The freedmen&#x27;s thirst for knowledge was undeniable. &quot;You will find them every hour of daylight, at their books,&quot; observed the Rev. Edward Pierce in March of 1863. &quot;We cannot enter a cabin, or tent, but that we see from one to three with books.&quot; Within no time Pierce and his wife had more than 150 students, and by the end of the summer, the addition of more missionaries enabled the school to accommodate between 300 and 400 children as well as 60 adults at a night school. In August, one of the teachers estimated that as many as 1,000 freedmen had learned to read in the Corinth camp.</p><p>Organized religion followed closely on the heels of formal education. Reverend Olds &quot;saw an earnestness in reference to the Christian life that I have seldom seen. And as I saw their deep earnestness &amp; heard their hearty responses,&quot; he said, &quot;I was led to ask where can we find a more impressible people than these?&quot;</p><p>The population of the camp fluctuated between 1,500 and 6,000, as large groups undertook assignments for the Union Army or contracted to work on local plantations. In March 1863, for example, the camp was home to 658 men, 1,440 women and 1,559 children. Among the men were 36 blacksmiths, 48 carpenters, 180 teamsters and 200 cooks. The female ranks included 80 seamstresses, 150 laundresses and 600 cooks. Two-thirds of the men and three-quarters of the women were married, and seven in eight women had children. According to John Eaton&#x27;s records, the camp had experienced 900 cases of illness, 189 deaths and 45 births.</p><p>Life at Corinth changed dramatically after a May 1863 visit by Adj. Gen.

The program put 400 acres under cultivation, 300 for cotton and 100 for vegetables. Each cabin also had its own subsistence garden. By May 1863, the success of the agricultural program and the presence of a multitude of skilled artisans produced a clear monthly profit of $4,000 to $5,000 for the government, as well as an admirably independent community that Eaton hoped might serve as a model for other camps.</p><p>Unfortunately, the success of the Corinth camp proved short-lived.

        "source": "A French teenager who was infected with HIV as a baby and given intensive drug therapy in early childhood has lived for more than 12 years without any treatment, raising hopes among scientists searching for a cure for Aids.</p><p>The case of the 18-year-old was presented at an Aids conference in Vancouver, Canada, by doctors at the Institut Pasteur who treated her. Like the so-called Mississippi baby, she became infected before birth and received drug treatment in the first weeks of her life.</p><p>Both children were denied follow-up care when their parents took them out of medical treatment and did not give them the prescribed drugs. The case of the US child caused huge excitement when the infant was brought back to the University of Mississippi medical centre in Jackson. Doctors talked in terms of a &quot;functional cure&quot;, because the child had no detectable virus.</p><p>However, the remission lasted only 27 months before the viral levels rose again in the child&#x27;s body. HIV scientists confessed to disappointment, although they said they would learn a huge amount from the case.</p><p>This time there is more caution. It is the first case of long-term remission in a child, say the French team, but they accept that it may not be permanent.</p><p>The child was born to a woman with untreated HIV and was given a drug for six weeks after her birth to try to prevent infection, but to no avail. Two months after the prophylactic drug was stopped, tests showed the infant had a high viral load and she was put on a cocktail of three antiretroviral medicines, which is the standard treatment for HIV.</p><p>When the girl was six years old, the family decided to stop the drugs and for six months doctors did not have contact with her. But when she was brought back, tests showed she had no detectable traces of the virus in her body. Twelve years and no drugs later, it is still undetectable \u2013 although experience has shown that does not mean there is not a hidden reservoir.</p><p>There are people known as &quot;elite controllers&quot; whose immune systems appear to keep the virus at bay, but according to Dr Asier S\u00e1ez-Ciri\u00f3n, of the HIV, inflammation and persistence unit at the Institut Pasteur in Paris, the Frenchwoman does not have the genetic factors associated with those. &quot;Most likely she has been in virological remission for so long because she received a combination of antiretrovirals very soon after infection.&quot;</p><p>That happened with a group of 14 adults in France, known as the Visconti cohort. They were treated with drugs soon after infection and all except two still have no detectable virus, even though they stopped taking the drugs years ago. Scientists think early treatment may limit the development of reservoirs of HIV and preserve the body&#x27;s immune system defences.</p><p>S\u00e1ez-Ciri\u00f3n said there were 580 people in France who contracted HIV as babies, of whom about 100 were given drug treatment within the first six months of life. Of those, 15 stopped treatment, but the virus rebounded within weeks or months in 13 of them. Of the two remaining, one lasted for three years without needing drugs and the other is the young woman who has been off treatment for 12 years.</p><p>She has a healthy life with no complications, but this girl is not cured. We&#x27;re talking about remission</p><p>&quot;She is doing perfectly well,&quot; said S\u00e1ez-Ciri\u00f3n. &quot;She has a healthy life with no complications.&quot; But he added: &quot;Very clearly this girl is not cured. We&#x27;re talking about remission.&quot;</p><p>The case was presented at the eighth International Aids Society (IAS) Conference on HIV pathogenesis, treatment and prevention. Prof Sharon Lewin, director of the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity at the University of Melbourne in Australia, said she thought it was interesting, but added: &quot;We really need to move beyond these anecdotal cases in our quest for a cure \u2026 the child received medication early after birth. We don&#x27;t know whether she would have controlled the virus anyway without receiving the medication. About 1% of people can do that.&quot;</p><p>Lewin, a member of the IAS Global Initiative Towards an HIV Cure, said trials were needed. It was universally recognised that people with HIV should be put on treatment as soon as possible after diagnosis. Itwas possible that some who had been treated early in their infection might be able to stop taking the drugs, but that had to be properly tested.</p><p>&quot;The only way we can address this is in a trial where we start a group of people very early on treatment and then randomise them to stop,&quot; she said. &quot;These studies are happening in Thailand at the moment. They are going to be really informative.&quot;",

What if you took one of that era&#x27;s hormone-drenched stu-coms and put real people in it?</p><p>The year is 1980, actually, and Jake (Blake Jenner from &quot;Glee&quot;) is arriving for his freshman year at (the fictional) Southeastern Texas State University. A high school pitching star and rangy college prospect, he&#x27;s assigned an off-campus baseball dorm with the other players. It&#x27;s a ready-made animal house, with rules laid down by a briefly seen coach (Jonathan Breck) that are immediately ignored. Occasionally we&#x27;ll get an onscreen reminder of how many dwindling days and hours remain before classes begin. These, too, are ignored.</p><p>Instead, Linklater parks his cameras to observe, with indulgence and much good humor, the bonding rituals of young men who only think they have it figured out. Jake&#x27;s housemates fall into general categories that re-sort themselves into individual personalities: The motor-mouthed ladies&#x27; man Finnegan (Glen Powell), the Zen surfer-stoner Willoughby (Wyatt Russell), uber-competitive McReynolds (Tyler Hoechlin), country rube Billy (Will Brittain), smartass Nesbit (Austin Amelio), na\u00efve Brumley (Tanner Kalina). And so on.</p><p>A few stand slightly outside the pack: the over-confident psycho-nerd pitcher Jay Niles (Juston Street, freakily funny) and the laconic second base star Dale Douglas (J. Quinton Johnson), whose blackness is rarely commented on. Where are the women? There to be chased and partied with and seduced. &quot;This is college, Jake,&quot; the hero is told early on. &quot;The girls can be as big sluts as the guys.&quot;</p><p>Oh, dear. Is &quot;Everybody Wants Some!!&quot; what happens when you people an entire Richard Linklater movie with Matthew McConaughey&#x27;s horndog Wooderson from &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot;? Yes and no, or, rather, yes, but only at first. As the boys sprawl through the last days of summer, the swagger that borders on smug begins to mellow and melt away. Searching for good times and girls, they hop from a disco one night to a country and western bar the next to a punk mosh pit to an art-student costume party, minds open, adapting, ever-changing. After a while, the hero starts having a smallish identity crisis, confessing that &quot;it sort of begs the question of who we are.&quot;</p><p>Well, yes. This is college, Jake. Even a high school sports star can be anyone he wants.</p><p>The movie eventually spins him off from the crowd into the arms of Beverly (Zoey Deutch), a tartly ardent stage arts freshman with Joni Mitchell posters on her wall. She&#x27;s unpretentious for a theater brat, he&#x27;s smart and soulful for a jock, and the two stand dazzled in the Venn diagram overlap of their attraction. These scenes try a little too hard to be charming but they are anyway, and if Deutch has the freckles and immediacy of a classic Brat Pack heroine, it may be because her mother is Lea Thompson of &quot;Back to the Future&quot; and &quot;Some Kind of Wonderful&quot; and her father is Howard Deutch, who directed the latter.</p><p>More second-generation pleasures: Wyatt Russell, who plays the woolly baseball mystic Willoughby, is the son of Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn, and he has a high old time \u2014 emphasis on high \u2014 explaining to his teammates why &quot;Fearless,&quot; from the 1971 album &quot;Meddle,&quot; is the best track that Pink Floyd ever recorded. Because he is correct, I am awarding &quot;Everybody Wants Some!!&quot; an extra half-star.</p><p>Linklater was a high school baseball player who went to Sam Houston State on a scholarship, and the movie is steeped in the lazy, rivalrous minutiae of college ball. Willoughby gets off a moment of bliss when he muses on the pleasures of pitching \u2014 &quot;It&#x27;s lovely out there on the bump,&quot; he says \u2014 and we learn that it&#x27;s the .230 hitters who are always the most superstitious. Also that it&#x27;s possible to slice a pitched baseball in half with an ax. At one point, one of the characters gazes with incredulity at a crowd of fellow students and says, &quot;I know what we&#x27;re doing here. We&#x27;re playing baseball. What are they doing here?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Everybody Wants Some!!&quot; is a nice long soak in the Proustian detritus of its era. Beverly drives a Gremlin, Jake knows the secret of winning at &quot;Space Invaders,&quot; and people can still confidently begin sentences with the words, &quot;It&#x27;s like Carl Sagan says. . .&quot; What &quot;Sweet Emotion&quot; was to &quot;Dazed and Confused,&quot; so the Knack&#x27;s &quot;My Sharona&quot; is to this movie, and the soundtrack rolls forward from there: glorious junk from the days when Eddie Rabbitt, Eddie Money, Sniff &#x27;n&#x27; the Tears, and the BusBoys meant something.</p><p>All that&#x27;s missing is a plot. But Linklater doesn&#x27;t do plot; he does life. Says Powell&#x27;s garrulous Finnegan, summing up the art of both this movie and this moviemaker, &quot;I don&#x27;t think at all. I just talk a lot. It&#x27;s jazz improv. You&#x27;re invited.&quot; And so are we.</p><p>Written and directed by Richard Linklater. Starring Blake Jenner, Zoey Deutch, Glen Powell, Wyatt Russell, Tyler Hoechlin, Juston Street. At Boston Common, Kendall Square. 117 minutes.

        "source": "Here are top moments from the House Select Committee hearing on Benghazi where former secretary of state Hillary Clinton testified. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)</p><p>The House Select Committee on Blumenthal, as some are now calling it, came to order at 10 a.m. Lawmakers didn&#x27;t finish questioning Hillary Clinton until 11 hours later \u2014 just after the Democratic presidential candidate succumbed to a coughing fit.</p><p>In that period of time, the name of Sidney Blumenthal was invoked more than 75 times, and scores of questions were asked about the longtime Clinton friend. By lunchtime, Blumenthal had been invoked 49 times \u2014 exactly the number of mentions of J. Christopher Stevens, the ambassador to Libya whose death in Benghazi is the supposed subject of the congressional probe. The other three Americans slain in Benghazi \u2014 Sean Smith, Glen Doherty, Tyrone Woods \u2014 got seven or eight mentions apiece, then-CIA director David Petraeus and former defense secretary Robert Gates each got two, and then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta had none.</p><p>Dana Milbank writes about political theater in the nation&#x27;s capital. He joined the Post as a political reporter in 2000.</p><p>Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), reading from Blumenthal&#x27;s e-mails to Clinton as if he were the teacher who had intercepted a note passed between two high school kids, said Blumenthal referred to Gates as &quot;a mean, vicious little&quot;\u2014 Gowdy paused. &quot;I&#x27;m not going to say the word, but he did.&quot;</p><p>He also quoted Blumenthal referring to then- national security adviser Thomas E. Donilon&#x27;s &quot;babbling rhetoric,&quot; and he said Blumenthal had referred to &quot;Obama&quot; (he &quot;left the &#x27;president&#x27; part out&quot;) and &quot;his political cronies in the White House and Chicago.&quot;</p><p>Clinton refused to get riled. &quot;I don&#x27;t know what this line of questioning does to help us get to the bottom of deaths of four Americans,&quot; she said.</p><p>But Gowdy knew. A couple of minutes later, he announced: &quot;I&#x27;ll tell you what: If you think you&#x27;ve heard about Sidney Blumenthal so far, wait until the next round.&quot;</p><p>He and his colleagues made good on that statement, posing questions on a Blumenthal visit to Clinton&#x27;s home, about his work for the Clinton Foundation, his business interests, his attempt to get a job at the State Department and his communication with the former secretary of state over matters as mundane as her new iPad. They were particularly concerned with whether Blumenthal&#x27;s advice to Clinton on Libya was &quot;unsolicited.&quot;</p><p>The Blumenthal focus shows that, after 17 months of probing Clinton, the Benghazi committee hasn&#x27;t come up with much. Blumenthal has been a Clinton hatchet man for years, and he has an unsavory reputation. The very mention of his name (he was prominent during the Monica Lewinsky scandal) lends a whiff of skulduggery to any situation.</p><p>But injecting Blumenthal as a central character in the Benghazi probe doesn&#x27;t help Republicans demonstrate that Clinton did wrong. And the justification for invoking him \u2014 to demonstrate that Clinton had more contact with him than with Stevens \u2014 is a stretch. Whatever else one thinks of the former journalist \u2014 I&#x27;ve clashed with him over the years \u2014 he had nothing to do with what happened in Libya on Sept. 11 and 12, 2012.</p><p>Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.) acted as if he had found a video of Blumenthal attacking the compound himself.

        "source": "MADRID (AP) \u2013 Spain&#x27;s grinding economic misery will get worse this year despite the country&#x27;s request for a European financial lifeline of up to $125 billion to save its banks, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said Sunday.</p><p>A day after the country conceded it needed outside help following months of denying it would seek assistance, Rajoy said more Spaniards will lose their jobs in a country where one out of every four are already unemployed.</p><p>&quot;This year is going to be a bad one,&quot; Rajoy said Sunday in his first comments about the rescue since it was announced the previous evening by his economy minister.</p><p>The conservative prime minister added that the economy, stuck in its second recession in three years, will still contract the previously predicted 1.7 percent even with the help. Small businesses and families starving for credit will eventually get relief as the funding props up banks and they increase lending, but Rajoy didn&#x27;t offer guidance on when.</p><p>Spain on Saturday became the fourth \u2014 and largest \u2014 of the 17 countries that use Europe&#x27;s common currency to request a bailout \u2014 a big blow to a nation that a few years ago took pride as the continent&#x27;s economic superstar only to see it become the hot spot in the eurozone debt crisis. Its economy is the eurozone&#x27;s fourth largest after Germany, France and Italy.</p><p>Across the country, Spaniards reacted with a mixture of anger and relief to the news. The amount of the rescue fund, if all is tapped, amounts to \u20ac21,000 of new debt for each person in the nation of 47 million where the average annual salary for those with work is about the same amount and the unemployment rate for those under age 25 is 52 percent.</p><p>The country is already reeling from deep austerity cuts Rajoy has imposed over the last six months that have raised taxes, made it easier to hire and fire workers, and cut deep into cherished government programs including education and national health care.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s obviously a shame,&quot; said civil servant Luisa Saraguren, 44, as she strolled on a sunny Sunday morning with her young daughter. &quot;But this bailout was fully predictable, and the consequences of this help are going to be a lot bigger compared to the cuts we&#x27;ve been living with already.&quot;</p><p>Rajoy took pains to avoid the word bailout Sunday, saying Spain&#x27;s rescue package is a line of credit that its most troubled banks will be able to tap. The assistance will not come with the outside control over government macroeconomic policy like that imposed Greece, Ireland and Portugal when their public finances were bailed out.</p><p>He said interest rates on the loans will be considerably lower than the rate near 7 percent that Spain has been forced to pay recently on the international debt markets, a level that forced the other countries to seek bailouts.</p><p>Spain will regain the economic credibility it has lost by shoring up its banks, which will result in credit being restored so businesses and individuals shut off from loans can start borrowing and the economy will grow again, Rajoy insisted, again without saying when.</p><p>Europe&#x27;s widening recession and financial crisis has hurt companies and investors around the world. Providing a financial lifeline to Spanish banks is likely to relieve anxiety on the Spanish economy \u2014 which is five times larger than Greece&#x27;s \u2014 and on markets concerned about the country&#x27;s ability to pay its way.</p><p>Spain&#x27;s financial problems are not due to Greek-style government over-spending. The country&#x27;s banks particularly its savings banks or &quot;cajas,&quot; got caught up in the collapse of a real estate bubble in 2008 that got worse over the past four years. However, as Spain&#x27;s leaders have struggled for a solution to their banking crisis, the country&#x27;s borrowing costs have soared close to the level that forced the governments of Greece, Portugal and Ireland to seek rescues.</p><p>Some of Spain&#x27;s banks are struggling with by toxic real estate loans and assets amid fears the problem will get worse as more jobless people can&#x27;t pay their mortgages. The Bank of Spain says the toxic loans and assets total around \u20ac180 billion. Nationalized lender Bankia SA, which has requested \u20ac19 billion in aid, has \u20ac32 billion in toxic assets. Around four other banks serving the domestic market are considered prime candidates for bailouts.</p><p>&quot;I could never get my mind round the scale of consumption in Spain over the past 20 years, having known it in the 1960s when it was still extremely poor,&quot; said Paul Preston, a history professor and expert on Spain with the London School of Economics. &quot;Lots of people enjoyed the consumer boom, but not everybody. Now everybody&#x27;s having to pay for it.&quot;</p><p>Rajoy blamed Spain&#x27;s woes on the previous Socialist administration of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero without mentioning him or his government by name. Zapatero was ousted by Rajoy in a landslide last November by voters outraged over the Socialist handling of the economy.</p><p>&quot;Last year Spain&#x27;s public administration spent \u20ac90 billion more than it took in, this can&#x27;t be maintained, we can&#x27;t live like that,&quot; Rajoy said.</p><p>But Socialist Party leader Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said Rajoy should acknowledge that Spain is now in bailout territory.</p><p>&quot;The government is trying to make us believe that we&#x27;ve won the lottery, that the Three Kings of Orient have arrived, and that isn&#x27;t so,&quot; Rubalcaba said.</p><p>After his press conference, Rajoy defended his decision to jet off an hour later to Poland to see Spain&#x27;s famed national football team take on Italy in the Euro 2012 competition. He said he would be on the ground in Gdansk only for the game before flying back to Madrid Sunday night.</p><p>&quot;I&#x27;ll be there two and a half hours and then I&#x27;ll leave,&quot; Rajoy said. &quot;I think the national team deserves it.&quot;",

        "source": "MADRID (AP) \u2013 Spain&#x27;s grinding economic misery will get worse this year despite the country&#x27;s request for a European financial lifeline of up to $125 billion to save its banks, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said Sunday.</p><p>A day after the country conceded it needed outside help following months of denying it would seek assistance, Rajoy said more Spaniards will lose their jobs in a country where one out of every four are already unemployed.</p><p>&quot;This year is going to be a bad one,&quot; Rajoy said Sunday in his first comments about the rescue since it was announced the previous evening by his economy minister.</p><p>The conservative prime minister added that the economy, stuck in its second recession in three years, will still contract the previously predicted 1.7 percent even with the help. Small businesses and families starving for credit will eventually get relief as the funding props up banks and they increase lending, but Rajoy didn&#x27;t offer guidance on when.</p><p>Spain on Saturday became the fourth \u2014 and largest \u2014 of the 17 countries that use Europe&#x27;s common currency to request a bailout \u2014 a big blow to a nation that a few years ago took pride as the continent&#x27;s economic superstar only to see it become the hot spot in the eurozone debt crisis. Its economy is the eurozone&#x27;s fourth largest after Germany, France and Italy.</p><p>Across the country, Spaniards reacted with a mixture of anger and relief to the news. The amount of the rescue fund, if all is tapped, amounts to \u20ac21,000 of new debt for each person in the nation of 47 million where the average annual salary for those with work is about the same amount and the unemployment rate for those under age 25 is 52 percent.</p><p>The country is already reeling from deep austerity cuts Rajoy has imposed over the last six months that have raised taxes, made it easier to hire and fire workers, and cut deep into cherished government programs including education and national health care.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s obviously a shame,&quot; said civil servant Luisa Saraguren, 44, as she strolled on a sunny Sunday morning with her young daughter. &quot;But this bailout was fully predictable, and the consequences of this help are going to be a lot bigger compared to the cuts we&#x27;ve been living with already.&quot;</p><p>Rajoy took pains to avoid the word bailout Sunday, saying Spain&#x27;s rescue package is a line of credit that its most troubled banks will be able to tap. The assistance will not come with the outside control over government macroeconomic policy like that imposed Greece, Ireland and Portugal when their public finances were bailed out.</p><p>He said interest rates on the loans will be considerably lower than the rate near 7 percent that Spain has been forced to pay recently on the international debt markets, a level that forced the other countries to seek bailouts.</p><p>Spain will regain the economic credibility it has lost by shoring up its banks, which will result in credit being restored so businesses and individuals shut off from loans can start borrowing and the economy will grow again, Rajoy insisted, again without saying when.</p><p>Europe&#x27;s widening recession and financial crisis has hurt companies and investors around the world. Providing a financial lifeline to Spanish banks is likely to relieve anxiety on the Spanish economy \u2014 which is five times larger than Greece&#x27;s \u2014 and on markets concerned about the country&#x27;s ability to pay its way.</p><p>Spain&#x27;s financial problems are not due to Greek-style government over-spending. The country&#x27;s banks particularly its savings banks or &quot;cajas,&quot; got caught up in the collapse of a real estate bubble in 2008 that got worse over the past four years. However, as Spain&#x27;s leaders have struggled for a solution to their banking crisis, the country&#x27;s borrowing costs have soared close to the level that forced the governments of Greece, Portugal and Ireland to seek rescues.</p><p>Some of Spain&#x27;s banks are struggling with by toxic real estate loans and assets amid fears the problem will get worse as more jobless people can&#x27;t pay their mortgages. The Bank of Spain says the toxic loans and assets total around \u20ac180 billion. Nationalized lender Bankia SA, which has requested \u20ac19 billion in aid, has \u20ac32 billion in toxic assets. Around four other banks serving the domestic market are considered prime candidates for bailouts.</p><p>&quot;I could never get my mind round the scale of consumption in Spain over the past 20 years, having known it in the 1960s when it was still extremely poor,&quot; said Paul Preston, a history professor and expert on Spain with the London School of Economics. &quot;Lots of people enjoyed the consumer boom, but not everybody. Now everybody&#x27;s having to pay for it.&quot;</p><p>Rajoy blamed Spain&#x27;s woes on the previous Socialist administration of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero without mentioning him or his government by name. Zapatero was ousted by Rajoy in a landslide last November by voters outraged over the Socialist handling of the economy.</p><p>&quot;Last year Spain&#x27;s public administration spent \u20ac90 billion more than it took in, this can&#x27;t be maintained, we can&#x27;t live like that,&quot; Rajoy said.</p><p>But Socialist Party leader Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said Rajoy should acknowledge that Spain is now in bailout territory.</p><p>&quot;The government is trying to make us believe that we&#x27;ve won the lottery, that the Three Kings of Orient have arrived, and that isn&#x27;t so,&quot; Rubalcaba said.</p><p>After his press conference, Rajoy defended his decision to jet off an hour later to Poland to see Spain&#x27;s famed national football team take on Italy in the Euro 2012 competition.

It&#x27;d be the right person at the right time, and I would encourage him to do it.&quot;</p><p>Pawlenty noted that Ronald Reagan ran unsuccessfully for president twice before being elected in his third attempt &quot;and was stronger for it.&quot; In contrast with Romney, Pawlenty said, &quot;the emerging class of Republican candidates is untested and unproven.&quot;</p><p>Within Romney&#x27;s political network, there has been informal chatter about a third run since early 2013, according to people familiar with the discussions. It bubbled up in phone calls and at dinners and has gained steam this year. Requests continue to pour in for him to appear on the campaign trail, and advisers said he is eager to mount a multi-state fly-around swing before Nov. 4.</p><p>In Iowa, however, Romney seemed uncomfortable with the 2016 talk. At the West Des Moines rally, he spoke for only five minutes, criticizing President Obama on income inequality, foreign affairs and other issues. When reporters tried to question him afterward, he sneaked into a dark maze of cubicles.</p><p>He also said that now that he was no longer a candidate, he had a joke to share involving Obama, golfer Phil Mickelson and tennis great Andre Agassi.</p><p>As Romney told it, Obama shows up at a bank to cash a check without his ID.

But what really intrigues him, they said, are the vulnerabilities among top-tier candidates in the Republican field. If Romney moves toward a race, it would be because he sees a path to victory.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s the market pulling him,&quot; said Kent Lucken, a longtime friend and adviser who accompanied Romney to Iowa. &quot;People look at Hillary as the likely Democratic nominee, and the party needs a strong leader who can stand up to her and who&#x27;s been through the process.&quot;</p><p>Romney is returning to Boston on Tuesday for a dinner that he and his wife, Ann, are hosting for former campaign advisers and business associates. The event \u2014 to benefit neurological research at Brigham and Women&#x27;s Hospital \u2014 has Romney intimates abuzz.</p><p>Save-the-date notices have gone out for the third annual Romney policy retreat in Park City, Utah, in June 2015 \u2014 a signal that he wants a platform to promote his issues as the presidential primary campaign season gets underway.</p><p>Romney is also mingling privately with top donors who could fund a third campaign. Romney visited Sept. 23 with Joe Ricketts, a billionaire investor who finances the Ending Spending super PAC, at Ricketts&#x27;s palatial penthouse apartment covering the entire 78th floor of the Time Warner Center in New York.</p><p>On Oct. 6, Romney also took part in a GOP fundraising dinner at the Manhattan apartment of Woody Johnson, the New York Jets owner and former Romney campaign finance chairman. Several 2016 hopefuls gave presentations to the donors, while Romney served as a co-host and made no pitch.</p><p>At Johnson&#x27;s home, Romney and media magnate Rupert Murdoch spoke about Romney&#x27;s political future. According to two Romney allies familiar with the conversation, Romney was cagey with Murdoch but expressed concerns about the developing GOP field. Romney told Murdoch that he felt uneasy about the party&#x27;s non-interventionist drift on foreign policy and the base&#x27;s embrace of ideological hard-liners.</p><p>Many Romney boosters believe that his window of opportunity will be in mid- to late 2015, should Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) or Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) ascend and party establishment types turn to Romney as a savior.</p><p>If former Florida governor Jeb Bush (R) opts out of a campaign, &quot;there is going to be more pressure on Mitt to go,&quot; said Tom Rath, an influential New Hampshire Republican.</p><p>At a luncheon this month in Atlanta to help GOP Senate nominee David Perdue, &quot;people sat up and paid attention&quot; to Romney, said Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.). &quot;I pulled him aside afterward to thank him for coming. He said he&#x27;s not running, and I take him at his word. But I don&#x27;t think the door is entirely closed, and circumstances can change.&quot;</p><p>That phrase \u2014 &quot;circumstances can change&quot; \u2014 has been repeated by many Romney backers since the former nominee used it to describe his own thinking about 2016 in a radio interview last month with Hugh Hewitt.</p><p>Spencer Zwick, Romney&#x27;s former national finance chairman, talks regularly with Romney and said he has been receiving daily calls from donors and other supporters. &quot;There are still plenty of donors who hope circumstances will change and there will be an opportunity for Romney to run again,&quot; he said.</p><p>Zwick is part of a slimmed-down inner circle, including longtime advisers Beth Myers, Peter Flaherty, Stuart Stevens, Lanhee Chen and aides Kelli Harrison and Matt Waldrip, who are advising Romney on political activities this fall.</p><p>Romney traveled through Iowa with three trusted advisers and friends: David Kochel, Ron Kaufman and Lucken. He also reunited with supporters from campaigns past. In Cedar Rapids, Romney spotted Jim Wilson, a Virginia man who logged more than 40,000 miles chasing the GOP nominee from coast to coast in his campaign-festooned GMC pickup. The two hugged. &quot;You son of a gun,&quot; Romney said.</p><p>Another fan, Gary Chidester, 64, came to the West Des Moines rally with a full coterie of Romney paraphernalia for the former candidate to autograph: campaign placards, enlarged photographs and buttons of Mitt and wife Ann, and paperback and audio copies of Romney&#x27;s book &quot;No Apology.&quot; He also held a framed drawing that a friend gave him of a black cruise ship named Obama sinking into the sea and a white ship named Romney with the caption, &quot;We&#x27;re here to save you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;He&#x27;s the only qualified person to run this time,&quot; Chidester said. &quot;Mitt is a business genius.

        "source": "We need a study to tell us things like this? My bad; I forgot that society no longer has common sense.</p><p>6 years ago my brother was found dead in his apartment. The only explanation the coroner gave my family was that his heart &quot;just stopped&quot;, and it was most likely due to the fact that he had been drinking what you call &quot;energy cocktails&quot; with friends the night before (red bull and vodka). Drinking these things doesnt just affect your decision making skills, or cause anxiety disorders, IT CAN KILL YOU.</p><p>PLEASE, everybody who reads this, remember uppers and downers DO NOT MIX</p><p>Why? This trend has happened in the past too with other stimulants. Stimulants with depressants have a synergistic effect in some cases trippling the effect of one or the other which can have deadly consequences. The people using these combinations, one need to grow up and stop mixing drinks like little kids at a coolaid party and two wake up before they cannot wake up...they mix drinks for attention and some mystical edge that those flakes think they get from mixing energy drinks and alcohol....sad.</p><p>Energy drinks are disgusting. Why would anyone mix them with alcohol?</p><p>When i was in college we would routinly drink all night long taking caffine pills through out to stay up. Its a lot of fun, I had such good times in college, I miss it. We would also inhale aerosol room deoderizers. That just made you kinda pass out and fall down, so not as much fun. I found that if I drank all night with the caffine pills I could smoke a one hitter just before going to sleep and I wouldnt have a hangover when I woke up. I could start the process over when I woke up. I did this 5-6 nights a week on average. I graduated with a 3.4 gpa and now I have a great job making 93k per year. So there really isnt any harm in this behavior.</p><p>Another misleading study. Forget that the people that drink energy drinks and alcohol together are just more riskier. Its the caffeine and alcohol combination that makes them morons. God forbid they are morons without the combination of the two.</p><p>alcohol + energy drinks = a great time!</p><p>Alcohol must be necessary to cut the awful taste of the energy drinks.</p><p>One major flaw in this study. Are the people who partake in this risky behaviour, including mixing caffiene and alcohol, more prone to this type of behaviour to begin with?</p><p>As a former &quot;cherry bomb&quot;, vodka-red bull, and jager-bomb drinker, I can appreciate the feeling you get when you drink caffiene and liquor. I never did anything extra risky when clubing and drinking these beverages. I also am not prone to risky behaviour other than the rare binge drinking.</p><p>Gee what do you know... more things that are bad for you!! What a bogus study. Too much of anything harmful to your body is going to do damage. I for one love the combo but only in moderation. Risky behavior... Give me a break! Driving your car or even going to a party or club is &quot;risky&quot; behavior. With all the sickos in the world today, no one is ever safe. Always be aware of your surroundings and always in moderation.</p><p>This article reminded me that I had a 5 hr energy drink in my computer bag. Thanks! that just saved my afternoon.</p><p>Also, I drank 2 \u2013 5hr energies at a party last weekend and had a blast. Caffeine is what makes the world go round and alcohol makes the world a cooler place. So if my logic is correct the two combined are a match made in heaven. Drink on!</p><p>Red bull and vodka is the modern, legal, &quot;speedball,&quot; and we all know that caffeine + liquor simply equals a wide-awake drunk.</p><p>So how is this riskier than just getting drunk and then trying to sober up by drinking black coffee?</p><p>I agree with everyone who says that vodka plus Red Bull is just legal crack.</p><p>We might as well give up on the War on Drugs right now.</p><p>It&#x27;s pointless to spend billions of dollars on fighting the cocaine cartels when you can just add vodka to Red Bull and get the same effect and the same damage to society from the perpetual overdoers.</p><p>Nothing new \u2013 someone once thought it was &#x27;fun&#x27; to mix barbituates with stimulants. The fact remains, risk increases, not decreases.</p><p>It&#x27;s always interesting to hear from those who justify questionable activity, whether or not it has been definitively determined to be risky. It usually begins with the phrase &#x27;...I like..&#x27;, as if the ends, the effect, justifies the means, the unknown mixture, regardless of the actual risks, usually unknown.</p><p>Well, some people like pit bulls, some like shooting AK&#x27;s at wildlife, some like driving SUV&#x27;s like sports cars, but, none of those are conducive to low risk, great decisions or desirable behavior.</p><p>The operative word here is MAY. This is not a definitive study and, therefore, any conclusions are not empirical.</p><p>Two of the worst hangovers I have ever had were the result of just 2 or 3 vodka-redbulls... No thanks, no more, that cured me.</p><p>This indicates a link to Anxiety and Manic Depressive behavior.</p><p>I used to drink energy drinks to help recover from the previous night. I then discovered that the energy drinks + alcohol were less expensive than plain energy drinks (go figure). These became my first drinks of the day...I am now in 12 step recovery.</p><p>Who wants to live low risk their whole life? The entire USA is a country of risk/pain/consequence averse cowards. Im surprised the Amish dont take over the country. They probably would if it werent for the language barrier.</p><p>&quot;So there really isn&#x27;t any harm in this behavior.&quot; \u2013</p><p>You&#x27;re an ignorant piece of trash, please die.</p><p>Ok, enough with people being all judgmental and comparing redbull and vodka to a freaking SPEEDBALL of heroin and cocaine. Um, not even close people. How many of you out there take your doctor-prescribed anti-anxiety pills with your morning coffee? Same thing.</p><p>And to the person who said &quot;pit bulls... [not] conducive to low risk, great decisions or desirable behavior&quot; I have a pitbull. They are VERY loving and loyal dogs. Even a poodle who is raised wrong can cause great injury to a person. I think it&#x27;s irresponsible to use owning a pitbull to try and make a point about reckless behavior. You are just spreading the hate. ANY dog raised in a sick environment can turn out dangerous.</p><p>Sometimes I will have an energy beer, or do some various &#x27;bomb&#x27; containing redbull and something 80-proof. Obviously when you&#x27;re hyper and drunk, you might do stupid things. When you&#x27;re drunk and tired, you might also do stupid things. I wish doctors and researchers would find a cure for cancer and AIDS and stop &#x27;researching&#x27; all of these common sense things! Ridiculous.</p><p>I like to start the night off with a energydrink and vodka mix. one or two to get me going and then I switch to beer. I have been doing this for years and have not noticed any problems with health or risk taking.</p><p>Taste Great, but yeah uppers + downers is a bad idea</p><p>To Poppy, I think I went to college with you and was perhaps involved in the debauchery...but don&#x27;t make nearly what you make, and not everyone is as lucky as you, or dodges as many life bullets as you have. word.</p><p>I am sorry to read the post about the brother who passed away, possibly related to the mixture of energy drinks and alcohol. That being said, there is an old saying....&quot;everything in moderation&quot;</p><p>PS \u2013 Red Bull and grape flavored Three Olives vodka is maaawney!!!</p><p>Patricia....Red Bull and vodka the same effect as cocaine? you probably have had neither because you clearly have no idea what you are talking about</p><p>Lester, redbull and vodka didn&#x27;t make you an alcoholic, I guess you&#x27;ve missed the step about taking responsibilitiy for your own actions.</p><p>I&#x27;m a professional, a mom and a wife who every once in a while(about half a dozen times a year) is called on by friends to go out and celebrate a special occassion. Unless I&#x27;m at a party I don&#x27;t ever drink (doesn&#x27;t entice me) . Maybe as a product of my generation, I&#x27;ve been drinking this combo for almost a decade. This study has no control for the initial propensity for risk that the individuals natrually possess. It certainly doesn&#x27;t make me more inclined to take any risks. What it does do for me is allow me to keep up with my non-parent friends who can stay up dancing until 5am. Otherwise, I&#x27;d pass out at 11pm (toddlers really make you tired, no need to make a study for that). I don&#x27;t over-do it. Those who do would overdo it and take risks no matter what they were drinking.</p><p>@johnna: that&#x27;s absurd. If there is any truth to your post, then your brother most likely died because he had a congenital heart defect that may have been exacerbated by the caffeine and/or sugar in the energy drink.</p><p>Glad to know that I only consumed a small qty of jagerbombs in my life \u2013 and never more than 1 in a single night. I no longer drink any sort of energy drink, they are just bad news all around.</p><p>So.... Vodka and Red Bull is bad, but an Irish Coffee is okay? Huh.</p><p>You need the alcohol mixers in order to drink the red bull \u2013 that stuff is just nasty \u2013 battery acid tasting. &quot;An acquired taste.&quot; Sorry, no thanks.</p><p>Moderation is key. Binge drinking is just plain stupid. When you have college students who think they will live forever, try to drink a keg themselves, or a liter of Jack Daniels at one sitting or ... your self-prescribed alcohol mix here ... then you will have problems.</p><p>Yes, first time binge drinkers can die. Yes, some alcoholic drinkers can drink all they way all the time and nothing &quot;serious&quot; happens to them, yet others imitating them can die. George Burns drank and smoke cigars til he died. Thousands of others imitating his kind of lifestyle died much sooner. We may never know what kept him from having problems.</p><p>I don&#x27;t drink, but if I did, I&#x27;d have an XS Energy Drink and some good vodka. 14 flavors, little caffiene (6 oz coffee amt) but 5000% Vitamin B12. Yes, it could make a more awake drunk. But you could also drink the XS Energy without the booze and not have a sugar crash later. Because it doesn&#x27;t have any sugar or carbs in it. Only 8 calories a can. And no acquired taste for battery acid required. www . jve . biz pwd: nutrition</p><p>Most of these posts scare me to death for today&#x27;s generation. I hope there aren&#x27;t many out there like you.</p><p>My preference is Tequila Bombs or Watermelon Crawls....a shot of tequila surrounded by the energy drink or 1/2 shot tequila and 1/2 shot watermelon pucker surrounded by energy drink. I usually drink about 12 of these on a &quot;party&quot; night. Feel real good all night and never feel sick the next day if I stop at 12. Anything after 12 can take a turn for the worse!</p><p>This is news? 30 years ago, it was caffiene tablets from the back of High Times and power drinking. 20 years ago, it was speed and power drinking. 10 years ago, energy drinks came on the scene and power drinkers have made the transition official. Now we have a study that advises if you give caffiene or other herbal stimulants to a power-drinker, then you get a wide-awake drunk. I wonder once again how much tax money was spent to tell me what I already knew. Does a Wide-Awake drunk engage in more risky behavior? DUH.... Is there a likelihood of Alcohol poisoning and even death in these situations? again, DUH.... The more things change, the more they remain the same.</p><p>What a ridiculous study. It&#x27;s sad that people even consider this news. There is more caffeine in headache medicine than in a Red Bull. I agree that some of the larger energy drinks, like Monster and Rockstar have quite a bit of caffeine....but mixing it with alcohol isn&#x27;t the problem. It&#x27;s the alcohol! People have been mixing liquor with coca cola and coffee forever and this is no different.</p><p>Caffeine and alcohol? Who would have *ever* thought of mixing those two?</p><p>Anyone ever heard of &quot;Rum &amp; Coke&quot; before?</p><p>And to the people who are equating mixing alcohol and energy drinks to cocaine, wow, you could not be more wrong.

I usually drink about 12 of these on a &quot;party&quot; night. Feel real good all night and never feel sick the next day if I stop at 12. Anything after 12 can take a turn for the worse!</p><p>This is news? 30 years ago, it was caffiene tablets from the back of High Times and power drinking. 20 years ago, it was speed and power drinking. 10 years ago, energy drinks came on the scene and power drinkers have made the transition official.

I wonder once again how much tax money was spent to tell me what I already knew. Does a Wide-Awake drunk engage in more risky behavior? DUH.... Is there a likelihood of Alcohol poisoning and even death in these situations? again, DUH.... The more things change, the more they remain the same.</p><p>What a ridiculous study. It&#x27;s sad that people even consider this news. There is more caffeine in headache medicine than in a Red Bull. I agree that some of the larger energy drinks, like Monster and Rockstar have quite a bit of caffeine....but mixing it with alcohol isn&#x27;t the problem. It&#x27;s the alcohol!

ANY dog raised in a sick environment can turn out dangerous.</p><p>Sometimes I will have an energy beer, or do some various &#x27;bomb&#x27; containing redbull and something 80-proof. Obviously when you&#x27;re hyper and drunk, you might do stupid things. When you&#x27;re drunk and tired, you might also do stupid things. I wish doctors and researchers would find a cure for cancer and AIDS and stop &#x27;researching&#x27; all of these common sense things! Ridiculous.</p><p>I like to start the night off with a energydrink and vodka mix. one or two to get me going and then I switch to beer. I have been doing this for years and have not noticed any problems with health or risk taking.</p><p>Taste Great, but yeah uppers + downers is a bad idea</p><p>To Poppy, I think I went to college with you and was perhaps involved in the debauchery...but don&#x27;t make nearly what you make, and not everyone is as lucky as you, or dodges as many life bullets as you have. word.</p><p>I am sorry to read the post about the brother who passed away, possibly related to the mixture of energy drinks and alcohol. That being said, there is an old saying....&quot;everything in moderation&quot;</p><p>PS \u2013 Red Bull and grape flavored Three Olives vodka is maaawney!!!</p><p>Patricia....Red Bull and vodka the same effect as cocaine? you probably have had neither because you clearly have no idea what you are talking about</p><p>Lester, redbull and vodka didn&#x27;t make you an alcoholic, I guess you&#x27;ve missed the step about taking responsibilitiy for your own actions.</p><p>I&#x27;m a professional, a mom and a wife who every once in a while(about half a dozen times a year) is called on by friends to go out and celebrate a special occassion. Unless I&#x27;m at a party I don&#x27;t ever drink (doesn&#x27;t entice me) . Maybe as a product of my generation, I&#x27;ve been drinking this combo for almost a decade. This study has no control for the initial propensity for risk that the individuals natrually possess. It certainly doesn&#x27;t make me more inclined to take any risks. What it does do for me is allow me to keep up with my non-parent friends who can stay up dancing until 5am. Otherwise, I&#x27;d pass out at 11pm (toddlers really make you tired, no need to make a study for that). I don&#x27;t over-do it. Those who do would overdo it and take risks no matter what they were drinking.</p><p>@johnna: that&#x27;s absurd. If there is any truth to your post, then your brother most likely died because he had a congenital heart defect that may have been exacerbated by the caffeine and/or sugar in the energy drink.</p><p>Glad to know that I only consumed a small qty of jagerbombs in my life \u2013 and never more than 1 in a single night. I no longer drink any sort of energy drink, they are just bad news all around.</p><p>So.... Vodka and Red Bull is bad, but an Irish Coffee is okay? Huh.</p><p>You need the alcohol mixers in order to drink the red bull \u2013 that stuff is just nasty \u2013 battery acid tasting. &quot;An acquired taste.&quot; Sorry, no thanks.</p><p>Moderation is key. Binge drinking is just plain stupid. When you have college students who think they will live forever, try to drink a keg themselves, or a liter of Jack Daniels at one sitting or ... your self-prescribed alcohol mix here ... then you will have problems.</p><p>Yes, first time binge drinkers can die. Yes, some alcoholic drinkers can drink all they way all the time and nothing &quot;serious&quot; happens to them, yet others imitating them can die. George Burns drank and smoke cigars til he died. Thousands of others imitating his kind of lifestyle died much sooner. We may never know what kept him from having problems.</p><p>I don&#x27;t drink, but if I did, I&#x27;d have an XS Energy Drink and some good vodka. 14 flavors, little caffiene (6 oz coffee amt) but 5000% Vitamin B12. Yes, it could make a more awake drunk. But you could also drink the XS Energy without the booze and not have a sugar crash later. Because it doesn&#x27;t have any sugar or carbs in it. Only 8 calories a can. And no acquired taste for battery acid required. www . jve . biz pwd: nutrition</p><p>Most of these posts scare me to death for today&#x27;s generation. I hope there aren&#x27;t many out there like you.</p><p>My preference is Tequila Bombs or Watermelon Crawls....a shot of tequila surrounded by the energy drink or 1/2 shot tequila and 1/2 shot watermelon pucker surrounded by energy drink. I usually drink about 12 of these on a &quot;party&quot; night. Feel real good all night and never feel sick the next day if I stop at 12. Anything after 12 can take a turn for the worse!</p><p>This is news? 30 years ago, it was caffiene tablets from the back of High Times and power drinking. 20 years ago, it was speed and power drinking. 10 years ago, energy drinks came on the scene and power drinkers have made the transition official. Now we have a study that advises if you give caffiene or other herbal stimulants to a power-drinker, then you get a wide-awake drunk. I wonder once again how much tax money was spent to tell me what I already knew. Does a Wide-Awake drunk engage in more risky behavior? DUH.... Is there a likelihood of Alcohol poisoning and even death in these situations? again, DUH.... The more things change, the more they remain the same.</p><p>What a ridiculous study. It&#x27;s sad that people even consider this news. There is more caffeine in headache medicine than in a Red Bull. I agree that some of the larger energy drinks, like Monster and Rockstar have quite a bit of caffeine....but mixing it with alcohol isn&#x27;t the problem. It&#x27;s the alcohol! People have been mixing liquor with coca cola and coffee forever and this is no different.</p><p>Caffeine and alcohol? Who would have *ever* thought of mixing those two?</p><p>Anyone ever heard of &quot;Rum &amp; Coke&quot; before?</p><p>And to the people who are equating mixing alcohol and energy drinks to cocaine, wow, you could not be more wrong. It is not even close to the same thing. Not even a little bit.</p><p>Hopefully they people get anxiety and depression and kill themselves before they cost all of money in the free health care they will require and get! Let&#x27;s all be idiots and then make everyone else pay the price.</p><p>BRILLIANT!!!! Kids that are 25 and younger in this country are absolutely useless anyway. Hopefully they wipe themselves out and we jump right to next generation. Afterall, it is the same people that have worshiped Britany Spears, Paris Hilton, The Hills, and energy drinks.</p><p>I think we will be ok if they all end up in mental hospitals or dead.</p><p>Risky behavior? I would think that&#x27;s the least of your concerns when your mixing uppers and downers. I feel like we might see the effects of those nasty drinks in studies done years from now on my peers that party hard. Eating a healthy diet, exercise and proper breathing also gives you energy...all day long!</p><p>Huh....I would think the mix would leave you with one heck of a hang over. The kind that feels like a spike in your brain.</p><p>@ Poppy: diaf pls. k, thnx</p><p>@ the rest of you: Chill out. You all are like watching people run around in circles pulling their hair out in a mad panic. omg omg this is hooooorible. We must lemming march and listen to these wise souls who tell us their correlational study is the gospel truth!</p><p>Alcohol has been a source of risky behavior since the dawn of, well, liquor. I don&#x27;t think adding a Red Bull or a Monster is going to make that any less true.</p><p>I really get annoyed when people leave comments just to say, &quot;This isn&#x27;t news!&quot; People need to be reminded once in a while if something isn&#x27;t a good idea. A lot of people mix energy drinks with alcohol. As for myself, usually consume my energy drink an hour or so before beginning a night out to shake off a mood, a feeling of sloth. So maybe my timing is OK? I haven&#x27;t noticed anything too unusual when I do this. It is wise to remember &quot;everything in moderation&quot;, as someone above said. It is common sense, but how many of of really practice that?</p><p>&quot;Woolsey says the danger isn&#x27;t specifically in the caffeine; it&#x27;s in the combination of drinks with the other stimulants potentially being more dangerous because people haven&#x27;t built up tolerances to them. Woolsey says many of these so called energy drinks contain unregulated herbal stimulants.&quot;</p><p>Did all of you totally miss this part? You all keep going on about the caffeine. Read a story in its entirety, dont lock on one thing and run with it like a 5 year old.</p><p>More junk &quot;science&quot; used to create sensational headlines.</p><p>College kids do crazy stuff, they always have and always will. Unfortunately some of us will not live through it.</p><p>There seems to be a lot of people in denial here.</p><p>As somebody who has had a red bull/vodka combination \u2013 there is a lot of truth to this study. It truly makes you feel sober when you are digustingly NOT.</p><p>Kudos to Ok State and Mizzou for trying to educate people \u2013too bad that it&#x27;s fallen on deaf ears.",

Over a three-day period, the pictures also captured him kissing her in a bar.

(See the 25 most influential evangelicals in America.)</p><p>Most Catholics probably don&#x27;t approve of Cuti\u00c3\u00a9&#x27;s affair. Still, will they back the archdiocese? Cuti\u00c3\u00a9&#x27;s punishment is understandable at first glance, at least for his hypocrisy if not for the betrayal of his oath of celibacy. To the Catholic Church, priestly ordination means a marriage vow to the church \u2014 the &quot;bride of Christ.&quot; In a statement, Miami Archbishop John Favalora said Cuti\u00c3\u00a9&#x27;s actions &quot;cannot be condoned despite the good work he&#x27;s done as a priest.&quot; (See pictures of a Catholic congregation fighting to save its church building.)</p><p>But Cutie&#x27;s penalty might elicit more than a few snickers from Catholics who have spent the past few decades watching the priestly perdition parade of sexual abuse, parish embezzlement and doctrinal intolerance. The Miami archdiocese has had to pay out millions of dollars in sexual-abuse settlements in recent years \u2014 including a case involving a former priest at Cuti\u00c3\u00a9&#x27;s South Beach church, St. Francis de Sales. (One of Cuti\u00c3\u00a9&#x27;s tasks, in fact, has been to heal the wounds inside that parish.) To his credit, Favalora is trying to restore public trust in his archdiocese and the Church. But so long as Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 wasn&#x27;t frolicking with a minor (female or male) or using parish funds to buy margaritas for his paramour, many parishioners may actually be relieved that their popular priest has a libido focused on a woman who has reached the age of consent.(Check out a story about the heartthrob of the Vatican.)</p><p>What&#x27;s more, one of the pillars of Cuti\u00c3\u00a9&#x27;s popularity is his relationship counseling. To any Catholic who&#x27;s had to suffer through a lecture on marriage from a celibate kid just out of seminary, Cuti\u00c3\u00a9&#x27;s romantic romp might just make him a more appealing priest \u2014 more human, perhaps, than Catholic clergy who deny communion to divorcees, gays and anyone else who dares violate the Church&#x27;s litany of &quot;non-negotiable&quot; rules. &quot;He was doing this fairly out in the open,&quot; notes one Miami Catholic who knows Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 well and has undergone marriage counseling with him. &quot;Most priests who do this usually try to hide it, but this wasn&#x27;t some dirty little tryst in the back of the parish residence. It doesn&#x27;t appear to be just about sex; it&#x27;s about intimacy, and he&#x27;s always been able to help people understand which is more important.&quot;</p><p>The attraction of the unidentified woman in the photos to Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 isn&#x27;t surprising, either. Cuti\u00c3\u00a9&#x27;s last name is pronounced koo-tee-AY, but that hasn&#x27;t stopped people from calling the handsome, telegenic priest &quot;Father Cutie&quot; \u2014 the kind of hunk-in-a-collar whom smitten Catholic schoolgirls often nickname &quot;Father What-a-Waste.&quot; In 1999, when he burst onto the scene just four years after his ordination with his first television talk show on the Spanish-language Telemundo network, Cambia Tu Vida Con Padre Alberto (Change Your Life With Father Alberto), he remarked to the Miami Herald that celibacy is &quot;a struggle, but it&#x27;s a good struggle.&quot;</p><p>It was a battle that Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 was perhaps destined to lose, not just because of his good looks but his celebrity. In the chaste, pre-Vatican II culture of the 1950s, no one would have dared wonder if a priestly TV phenom like Bishop Fulton Sheen had a girlfriend. But today, the temptations for an attractive media star, ordained or not, are greater \u2014 especially in the narcissistic Gomorrah of South Beach. And Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 was never a shy altar boy to begin with. Born in Puerto Rico to Cuban parents, he was a popular deejay as a teen, and he still likes disco music and getting buff in the gym.</p><p>That&#x27;s not to say, however, that Cuti\u00e9 is a liberal priest. His current television talk show, Hablando Con Padre Alberto (Talking With Father Alberto), is aired on the conservative Catholic network EWTN (Eternal World Television Network) founded by the engaging but dogmatically stern nun, Mother Angelica. Last December he blasted Playboy&#x27;s Mexican edition for what he called a &quot;blasphemous&quot; cover photo that depicted a model as the Virgin Mary. On his shows on the Radio Paz (Radio Peace) network, and in his columns and books, such as Ama de Verdad, Vive de Verdad (Real Love, Real Life), Cuti\u00e9 usually toes the Vatican&#x27;s doctrinal line on issues like abortion.</p><p>Nonetheless, the Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 scandal is sure to ratchet up debate over clerical celibacy in the Catholic Church, a spiritual ideal that seems to collide more often today with biological reality. (See the recent paternity-suit travails of Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo, who has admitted to fathering a child, and is alleged to have sired others, while he was still a priest.) A bigger problem for the Church, however, may be Cuti\u00c3\u00a9&#x27;s Oprah-like standing in the Latino community \u2014 the only demographic where U.S. Catholicism is experiencing growth. America&#x27;s Catholic bishops, many of whom are widely accused of allowing the sexual abuse crisis to happen, must realize that Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 is more well regarded among Catholics than they are, especially among Latinos, meaning the hierarchy will probably need to handle the tele-priest&#x27;s future with special care.</p><p>For his part, Cuti\u00e9 said in his statement that &quot;the commitment I made to serve God will remain intact,&quot; a vague message that left many of his parishioners wondering if he plans to stay in the priesthood. Regardless, Cuti\u00e9&#x27;s Miami Catholic friend notes that the priest, and the Church, need to recognize &quot;that there&#x27;s another human being involved in this, the woman in the pictures, and if they&#x27;re not sensitive to her as well they&#x27;re looking at double the scandal.&quot;</p><p>In his statement, Favalora said, &quot;Scandals such as this offer an occasion for the Church on all levels to examine our consciences regarding the integrity of our commitments.&quot; He&#x27;s right; but scandals like this also prompt Catholics to more closely and critically examine the battered integrity of their Church. And while they may not applaud Cuti\u00e9 for tasting forbidden fruit, they may not condemn him as harshly as the Church thinks they should either.",

(One of Cuti\u00c3\u00a9&#x27;s tasks, in fact, has been to heal the wounds inside that parish.) To his credit, Favalora is trying to restore public trust in his archdiocese and the Church. But so long as Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 wasn&#x27;t frolicking with a minor (female or male) or using parish funds to buy margaritas for his paramour, many parishioners may actually be relieved that their popular priest has a libido focused on a woman who has reached the age of consent.(Check out a story about the heartthrob of the Vatican.)</p><p>What&#x27;s more, one of the pillars of Cuti\u00c3\u00a9&#x27;s popularity is his relationship counseling. To any Catholic who&#x27;s had to suffer through a lecture on marriage from a celibate kid just out of seminary, Cuti\u00c3\u00a9&#x27;s romantic romp might just make him a more appealing priest \u2014 more human, perhaps, than Catholic clergy who deny communion to divorcees, gays and anyone else who dares violate the Church&#x27;s litany of &quot;non-negotiable&quot; rules. &quot;He was doing this fairly out in the open,&quot; notes one Miami Catholic who knows Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 well and has undergone marriage counseling with him. &quot;Most priests who do this usually try to hide it, but this wasn&#x27;t some dirty little tryst in the back of the parish residence. It doesn&#x27;t appear to be just about sex; it&#x27;s about intimacy, and he&#x27;s always been able to help people understand which is more important.&quot;</p><p>The attraction of the unidentified woman in the photos to Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 isn&#x27;t surprising, either. Cuti\u00c3\u00a9&#x27;s last name is pronounced koo-tee-AY, but that hasn&#x27;t stopped people from calling the handsome, telegenic priest &quot;Father Cutie&quot; \u2014 the kind of hunk-in-a-collar whom smitten Catholic schoolgirls often nickname &quot;Father What-a-Waste.&quot; In 1999, when he burst onto the scene just four years after his ordination with his first television talk show on the Spanish-language Telemundo network, Cambia Tu Vida Con Padre Alberto (Change Your Life With Father Alberto), he remarked to the Miami Herald that celibacy is &quot;a struggle, but it&#x27;s a good struggle.&quot;</p><p>It was a battle that Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 was perhaps destined to lose, not just because of his good looks but his celebrity. In the chaste, pre-Vatican II culture of the 1950s, no one would have dared wonder if a priestly TV phenom like Bishop Fulton Sheen had a girlfriend. But today, the temptations for an attractive media star, ordained or not, are greater \u2014 especially in the narcissistic Gomorrah of South Beach. And Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 was never a shy altar boy to begin with. Born in Puerto Rico to Cuban parents, he was a popular deejay as a teen, and he still likes disco music and getting buff in the gym.</p><p>That&#x27;s not to say, however, that Cuti\u00e9 is a liberal priest. His current television talk show, Hablando Con Padre Alberto (Talking With Father Alberto), is aired on the conservative Catholic network EWTN (Eternal World Television Network) founded by the engaging but dogmatically stern nun, Mother Angelica. Last December he blasted Playboy&#x27;s Mexican edition for what he called a &quot;blasphemous&quot; cover photo that depicted a model as the Virgin Mary. On his shows on the Radio Paz (Radio Peace) network, and in his columns and books, such as Ama de Verdad, Vive de Verdad (Real Love, Real Life), Cuti\u00e9 usually toes the Vatican&#x27;s doctrinal line on issues like abortion.</p><p>Nonetheless, the Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 scandal is sure to ratchet up debate over clerical celibacy in the Catholic Church, a spiritual ideal that seems to collide more often today with biological reality. (See the recent paternity-suit travails of Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo, who has admitted to fathering a child, and is alleged to have sired others, while he was still a priest.) A bigger problem for the Church, however, may be Cuti\u00c3\u00a9&#x27;s Oprah-like standing in the Latino community \u2014 the only demographic where U.S. Catholicism is experiencing growth. America&#x27;s Catholic bishops, many of whom are widely accused of allowing the sexual abuse crisis to happen, must realize that Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 is more well regarded among Catholics than they are, especially among Latinos, meaning the hierarchy will probably need to handle the tele-priest&#x27;s future with special care.</p><p>For his part, Cuti\u00e9 said in his statement that &quot;the commitment I made to serve God will remain intact,&quot; a vague message that left many of his parishioners wondering if he plans to stay in the priesthood. Regardless, Cuti\u00e9&#x27;s Miami Catholic friend notes that the priest, and the Church, need to recognize &quot;that there&#x27;s another human being involved in this, the woman in the pictures, and if they&#x27;re not sensitive to her as well they&#x27;re looking at double the scandal.&quot;</p><p>In his statement, Favalora said, &quot;Scandals such as this offer an occasion for the Church on all levels to examine our consciences regarding the integrity of our commitments.&quot; He&#x27;s right; but scandals like this also prompt Catholics to more closely and critically examine the battered integrity of their Church. And while they may not applaud Cuti\u00e9 for tasting forbidden fruit, they may not condemn him as harshly as the Church thinks they should either.",

Born in Puerto Rico to Cuban parents, he was a popular deejay as a teen, and he still likes disco music and getting buff in the gym.</p><p>That&#x27;s not to say, however, that Cuti\u00e9 is a liberal priest. His current television talk show, Hablando Con Padre Alberto (Talking With Father Alberto), is aired on the conservative Catholic network EWTN (Eternal World Television Network) founded by the engaging but dogmatically stern nun, Mother Angelica. Last December he blasted Playboy&#x27;s Mexican edition for what he called a &quot;blasphemous&quot; cover photo that depicted a model as the Virgin Mary. On his shows on the Radio Paz (Radio Peace) network, and in his columns and books, such as Ama de Verdad, Vive de Verdad (Real Love, Real Life), Cuti\u00e9 usually toes the Vatican&#x27;s doctrinal line on issues like abortion.</p><p>Nonetheless, the Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 scandal is sure to ratchet up debate over clerical celibacy in the Catholic Church, a spiritual ideal that seems to collide more often today with biological reality. (See the recent paternity-suit travails of Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo, who has admitted to fathering a child, and is alleged to have sired others, while he was still a priest.) A bigger problem for the Church, however, may be Cuti\u00c3\u00a9&#x27;s Oprah-like standing in the Latino community \u2014 the only demographic where U.S. Catholicism is experiencing growth. America&#x27;s Catholic bishops, many of whom are widely accused of allowing the sexual abuse crisis to happen, must realize that Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 is more well regarded among Catholics than they are, especially among Latinos, meaning the hierarchy will probably need to handle the tele-priest&#x27;s future with special care.</p><p>For his part, Cuti\u00e9 said in his statement that &quot;the commitment I made to serve God will remain intact,&quot; a vague message that left many of his parishioners wondering if he plans to stay in the priesthood.

        "source": "If only it were the worst thing that a Roman Catholic priest has been caught doing. The Mexican celebrity magazine TVnotas recently published 25 paparazzi photos of the Rev. Alberto Cuti\u00e9, the popular Miami Beach priest famous for his Spanish-language television and radio talk shows, cavorting amorously on a Florida beach with an attractive woman. Over a three-day period, the pictures also captured him kissing her in a bar. In one of TVnotas&#x27;s &quot;in fragranti&quot; shots [Note to TVnotas copy editors: it&#x27;s &quot;in flagrante&quot;] the woman wraps her legs around Cuti\u00e9; in another, Cuti\u00e9 has a hand down her swimsuit, fondling her rear end.</p><p>Because of the scandal, the Archdiocese of Miami says Cuti\u00e9, 40, is no longer the administrator of his Miami Beach parish, and it has barred him from leading Sunday mass there. His media work seems up in the air now, and the popular website padrealberto.net has only a blue screen with a message from Cuti\u00e9 asking forgiveness. (See the 25 most influential evangelicals in America.)</p><p>Most Catholics probably don&#x27;t approve of Cuti\u00c3\u00a9&#x27;s affair. Still, will they back the archdiocese? Cuti\u00c3\u00a9&#x27;s punishment is understandable at first glance, at least for his hypocrisy if not for the betrayal of his oath of celibacy. To the Catholic Church, priestly ordination means a marriage vow to the church \u2014 the &quot;bride of Christ.&quot; In a statement, Miami Archbishop John Favalora said Cuti\u00c3\u00a9&#x27;s actions &quot;cannot be condoned despite the good work he&#x27;s done as a priest.&quot; (See pictures of a Catholic congregation fighting to save its church building.)</p><p>But Cutie&#x27;s penalty might elicit more than a few snickers from Catholics who have spent the past few decades watching the priestly perdition parade of sexual abuse, parish embezzlement and doctrinal intolerance. The Miami archdiocese has had to pay out millions of dollars in sexual-abuse settlements in recent years \u2014 including a case involving a former priest at Cuti\u00c3\u00a9&#x27;s South Beach church, St. Francis de Sales. (One of Cuti\u00c3\u00a9&#x27;s tasks, in fact, has been to heal the wounds inside that parish.) To his credit, Favalora is trying to restore public trust in his archdiocese and the Church. But so long as Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 wasn&#x27;t frolicking with a minor (female or male) or using parish funds to buy margaritas for his paramour, many parishioners may actually be relieved that their popular priest has a libido focused on a woman who has reached the age of consent.(Check out a story about the heartthrob of the Vatican.)</p><p>What&#x27;s more, one of the pillars of Cuti\u00c3\u00a9&#x27;s popularity is his relationship counseling. To any Catholic who&#x27;s had to suffer through a lecture on marriage from a celibate kid just out of seminary, Cuti\u00c3\u00a9&#x27;s romantic romp might just make him a more appealing priest \u2014 more human, perhaps, than Catholic clergy who deny communion to divorcees, gays and anyone else who dares violate the Church&#x27;s litany of &quot;non-negotiable&quot; rules. &quot;He was doing this fairly out in the open,&quot; notes one Miami Catholic who knows Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 well and has undergone marriage counseling with him. &quot;Most priests who do this usually try to hide it, but this wasn&#x27;t some dirty little tryst in the back of the parish residence. It doesn&#x27;t appear to be just about sex; it&#x27;s about intimacy, and he&#x27;s always been able to help people understand which is more important.&quot;</p><p>The attraction of the unidentified woman in the photos to Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 isn&#x27;t surprising, either. Cuti\u00c3\u00a9&#x27;s last name is pronounced koo-tee-AY, but that hasn&#x27;t stopped people from calling the handsome, telegenic priest &quot;Father Cutie&quot; \u2014 the kind of hunk-in-a-collar whom smitten Catholic schoolgirls often nickname &quot;Father What-a-Waste.&quot; In 1999, when he burst onto the scene just four years after his ordination with his first television talk show on the Spanish-language Telemundo network, Cambia Tu Vida Con Padre Alberto (Change Your Life With Father Alberto), he remarked to the Miami Herald that celibacy is &quot;a struggle, but it&#x27;s a good struggle.&quot;</p><p>It was a battle that Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 was perhaps destined to lose, not just because of his good looks but his celebrity. In the chaste, pre-Vatican II culture of the 1950s, no one would have dared wonder if a priestly TV phenom like Bishop Fulton Sheen had a girlfriend. But today, the temptations for an attractive media star, ordained or not, are greater \u2014 especially in the narcissistic Gomorrah of South Beach. And Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 was never a shy altar boy to begin with. Born in Puerto Rico to Cuban parents, he was a popular deejay as a teen, and he still likes disco music and getting buff in the gym.</p><p>That&#x27;s not to say, however, that Cuti\u00e9 is a liberal priest.
